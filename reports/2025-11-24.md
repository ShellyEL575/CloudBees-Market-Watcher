- [Show HN: Quick install script for self-hosted Forgejo (Git+CI) server](https://wkoszek.github.io/easyforgejo/) — I wanted to get Forgejo on my VM on a local NAS fast, and I realized that getting everything running with Git and CI working was ... harder than I anticipated. After spending more time than I wanted, and bugging lovely people at Forgejo's matrix, I came up with this: https://wkoszek.github.io/easyforgejo/ With this script, you should get Forgejo installed on your Linux computer in 2min. I tested this on a VM for now, and it works well enough for beta launch. Repo is here: https://github.com/wkoszek/easyforgejo Let me know what you think and submit PRs if you find bugs. I'd not use it in production just yet. Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45994118 Points: 4 # Comments: 2

- [Show HN: MemBrowse - CI/CD memory footprint tracking for embedded firmware](https://membrowse.com) — Built this after working with Intel’s Bluetooth firmware team - we kept seeing builds suddenly fail because memory crept up a few bytes at a time until it overflowed. Then everyone lost hours/days bisecting symbols and linker maps to figure out which commit pushed it over. So I made a CI tool that tracks firmware memory footprint across commits and flags bloat before it breaks the build. How it works: CLI parses ELF + DWARF, extracts per-section/per-symbol/per-file size info CI uploads reports; the platform stores history and generates diffs Shows exactly what changed between commits (what grew, where, and by how much) Optional memory budgets via commit keywords (acts as a CI gate to block regressions) The report generator is open source: https://github.com/membrowse/membrowse-action Works with GitHub Actions or any CI, tested on ARM, ESP32, ARC, x86 (multiple toolchains). There’s also a live demo analyzing MicroPython firmware builds at membrowse.com. Curious to hear from embedded folks: * How do you track code size / memory usage today? * What would stop you from adding this type of check to CI? * What’s missing that would make this genuinely useful for your workflow?

- [Ask HN: Where to Migrate as an IT Support/DevOps Engineer for Work?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45942862) — Whatever I do and learn no progress is going to happen in my country(nepal). There is no benefit of having merit in Nepal. Private jobs are already low paying. Remote jobs do not come generally to Nepal.I see remote jobs love India and south east asia. I do not get the point of remote job if they are hiring from specific country. The only thing I can do in nepal is public service commission (civil services) and crack computer engineer. But the pay is meagre there as well, unless I am lucky enough to enter central bank of Nepal(NRB). Honestly, it feels like I am pushing not just a wall but universe itself in Nepal. Because nothing is going to happen irrespective of my abilities. I am currently preparing for PSC and I do not believe I will be happy as a PSC engineer even if I end up at NRB(central bank). Something feels missing inside me. I have took countless therapies and what not. They helped me a lot to be where I am at now. I feel scared to try opportunities out of my comfort zone (kathmandu is my comfort zone). As an adult, nobody pushes you, you have to push yourself. I am in a serious deadlock internally. I can decrease the effect using yoga and meditation but that does not t

- [GitLab engineer: How I improved my onboarding experience with AI](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/gitlab-engineer-how-i-improved-my-onboarding-experience-with-ai/) — Starting a new job is exciting, and overwhelming. New teammates, new tools, and, in GitLab’s case, a lot of documentation. Six weeks ago, I joined GitLab’s Growth team as a fullstack engineer. Anyone who has gone through onboarding at GitLab knows it’s transparent, extensive, and thorough. GitLab's onboarding process includes a lot of docs, videos, and trainings that will bring you up to speed. Also, in line with GitLab's values, my team encouraged me to start contributing right away. I quickly realized that onboarding here is both diligent and intense. Luckily, I had a secret helper: GitLab Duo . My main use cases I’ve found GitLab Duo's AI assistance, available throughout the software development lifecycle, useful in three key areas: exploration, reviewing, and debugging. With GitLab Duo, I was able to get my first tiny MR deployed to production in the first week and actively contribute to the personal homepage in GitLab 18.5 in the weeks after. Exploration Early in onboarding, I often remembered reading something but couldn’t recall where. GitLab has a public-facing handbook , an internal handbook, and GitLab Docs . It can be difficult to search across all of them efficiently. G

- [Ace your planning without the context-switching](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/ace-your-planning-without-the-context-switching/) — Software development teams face a challenging balancing act: dozens of tasks, limited time, and constant pressure to pick the right thing to work on next. The planning overhead of structuring requirements, managing backlogs, tracking delivery, and writing status updates steals hours from strategic thinking. The result? Less time for the high-value decisions that actually drive products forward. That’s why we developed GitLab Duo Planner , an AI agent built on GitLab Duo Agent Platform to support product managers directly within GitLab. GitLab Duo Planner isn't another generic AI assistant. GitLab's product and engineering teams, who live these challenges daily like many of our customers, purpose-built GitLab Duo Planner to orchestrate planning workflows and reduce overhead while improving alignment and predictability. Your new planning teammate Today’s planning workflows face three major problems: Prone to drift - Unplanned and orphaned work reduce trust in the plan. Disruptive to developers - Constant interruptions for status updates break flow. Opaque - Hidden risks surface too late to course-correct. Transforming the way teams work, GitLab Duo Planner turns manual overhead like

- [Optimize GitLab object storage for scale and performance](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/optimize-gitlab-object-storage-for-scale-and-performance/) — Managing GitLab at scale requires strategic object storage configuration. Here's how to configure object storage for maximum performance, security, and reliability across your GitLab components. Use consolidated form for GitLab components For artifacts, LFS, uploads, packages, and other GitLab data, eliminate credential duplication with the consolidated form: gitlab_rails['object_store']['connection'] = { 'provider' =&gt; 'AWS', 'region' =&gt; 'us-east-1', 'use_iam_profile' =&gt; true } gitlab_rails['object_store']['objects']['artifacts']['bucket'] = 'gitlab-artifacts' gitlab_rails['object_store']['objects']['lfs']['bucket'] = 'gitlab-lfs' # ... additional buckets for each object type ``` This reduces complexity while enabling encrypted S3 buckets and proper Content-MD5 headers. ## Configure container registry separately The container registry requires its own configuration since it doesn't support the consolidated form: ``` registry['storage'] = { 's3_v2' =&gt; { # Use the new v2 driver 'bucket' =&gt; 'gitlab-registry', 'region' =&gt; 'us-east-1', # Omit access keys to use IAM roles } } Note: The s3_v1 driver is deprecated and will be removed in GitLab 19.0. Migrate to s3_v2 for b
- [How GitLab transforms embedded systems testing cycles](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/how-gitlab-transforms-embedded-systems-testing-cycles/) — Embedded developers know this cycle well: write code, wait days or weeks to test on a hardware test bench, discover bugs, fix them, then wait again. Virtual testing environments promise faster feedback, but most implementations create new problems such as environment sprawl and escalating costs. GitLab's managed lifecycle environments solve these virtual testing challenges. Through virtual environment automation, GitLab accelerates embedded development cycles without the configuration complexity and cost overruns. Virtual testing challenges Virtual testing environments — simulated hardware setups that replicate embedded system behavior and real-world conditions — offer the potential to reduce hardware bottlenecks. Teams can test firmware on simulated processors, run model-in-the-loop (MIL) tests in MATLAB/Simulink, or verify software on virtual embedded systems without waiting for physical hardware access. However, teams often implement virtual environments using one of two common approaches, both of which create unsustainable challenges. Flawed approach 1: Pipeline lifecycle environments Pipeline lifecycle environments re-create the entire testing setup for every CI/CD run. When c

Users now have the flexibility to choose Claude Sonnet 4.5 alongside other leading models, enhancing their GitLab Duo experience with upgrades in tool orchestration, context editing, and domain-specific capabilities. With top performance on SWE-bench Verified (77.2% ) and strengths in cybersecurity, finance, and research-heavy workflows, GitLab users can apply Claude Sonnet 4.5 to bring sharper insights and deeper context to their development work. &quot;Having Claude Sonnet 4.5 in GitLab is a big win for developers. It’s a really capable coding model, and, when you use it with the GitLab Duo Agent Platform, you get smarter help right in your workflows. It’s the kind of step that makes development easier,&quot; said Taylor McCaslin, Principal, Strategy and Operations for AI Partnerships at GitLab. GitLab Duo Agent Platform + Claude Sonnet 4.5 GitLab Duo Agent Platform extends the value of Claude Sonnet 4.5 by orchestrating agents, connecting them to internal systems, and integrating them throughout the software lifecycle.

- [Show HN: MemBrowse - CI/CD memory footprint tracking for embedded firmware](https://membrowse.com) — Built this after working with Intel’s Bluetooth firmware team - we kept seeing builds suddenly fail because memory crept up a few bytes at a time until it overflowed. Then everyone lost hours/days bisecting symbols and linker maps to figure out which commit pushed it over. So I made a CI tool that tracks firmware memory footprint across commits and flags bloat before it breaks the build. How it works: CLI parses ELF + DWARF, extracts per-section/per-symbol/per-file size info CI uploads reports; the platform stores history and generates diffs Shows exactly what changed between commits (what grew, where, and by how much) Optional memory budgets via commit keywords (acts as a CI gate to block regressions) The report generator is open source: https://github.com/membrowse/membrowse-action Works with GitHub Actions or any CI, tested on ARM, ESP32, ARC, x86 (multiple toolchains). There’s also a live demo analyzing MicroPython firmware builds at membrowse.com. Curious to hear from embedded folks: * How do you track code size / memory usage today? * What would stop you from adding this type of check to CI? * What’s missing that would make this genuinely useful for your workflow?

There is no benefit of having merit in Nepal. Private jobs are already low paying. Remote jobs do not come generally to Nepal.I see remote jobs love India and south east asia. I do not get the point of remote job if they are hiring from specific country. The only thing I can do in nepal is public service commission (civil services) and crack computer engineer. But the pay is meagre there as well, unless I am lucky enough to enter central bank of Nepal(NRB). Honestly, it feels like I am pushing not just a wall but universe itself in Nepal. Because nothing is going to happen irrespective of my abilities. I am currently preparing for PSC and I do not believe I will be happy as a PSC engineer even if I end up at NRB(central bank). Something feels missing inside me. I have took countless therapies and what not. They helped me a lot to be where I am at now.

- [GitLab 18.6: From configuration to control](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/gitlab-18-6-from-configuration-to-control/) — Editor’s note: After this blog was originally published, the default Security Manager role was withdrawn from the release. It will be included in a future update. The content below has been updated for accuracy. With GitLab 18.6 , we’re continuing to advance how AI integrates into everyday software development with enhancements that give teams greater choice and control. GitLab 18.6 will help plan, build, and secure software more intelligently across the entire software lifecycle. Teams now have greater flexibility to select the right models for their workflows, extend AI into secure and self-managed environments, and strengthen visibility and governance across every stage of development.

- [Achieve CMMC Level 2 with GitLab Dedicated for Government](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/achieve-cmmc-level-2-fast-with-gitlab-dedicated-for-government/) — For Defense Industrial Base (DIB) companies, the U.S. Department of Defense's release of the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) Final Rule and new guidance on “FedRAMP equivalency” has dramatically increased the cost of compliance and fundamentally changed the way in which they drive their risk management programs. Gone is the era of “self-attestation” of security programs; DIB companies are required to strictly apply NIST 800-171 to their environments that handle Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI), and have their security controls audited by a Third-Party Assessment Organization (3PAO) every three years. DIB companies are engineering focused, not compliance driven, and formal audits get pricey quickly. These changes add significant complications for companies focused on supporting the warfighter. The good news? GitLab Dedicated for Government's FedRAMP Moderate Authorization means DIB companies can directly use GitLab Dedicated for Government with no additional audits or authorizations, which reduces the impact and cost of compliance. The foundational rule: FedRAMP Moderate Equivalency The protection of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) within the DIB
- [Secure AI agent deployment to GKE](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/secure-ai-agent-deployment-to-gke/) — Building AI agents is exciting, but deploying them securely to production shouldn't be complicated. In this tutorial, you will learn how GitLab's native Google Cloud integration makes it straightforward to deploy AI agents to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) — with built-in scanning and zero service account keys. Why choose GKE to deploy your AI agents? GKE provides enterprise-grade orchestration that connects seamlessly with GitLab CI/CD pipelines through OIDC authentication. Your development team can deploy AI agents while maintaining complete visibility, compliance, and control over your cloud infrastructure. This guide uses Google's Agent Development Kit ( ADK ) to build the app, so you can expect increased seamlessness as this is deployed using GitLab. Three key advantages to this approach: Full infrastructure control - Your data, your rules, your environment. You maintain complete control over where your AI agents run and how they're configured. Native GitLab integration - No complex workarounds. Your existing pipelines work right out of the box thanks to GitLab's native integration with Google Cloud. Production-grade scaling - GKE automatically handles the heavy lifting of sca
- [Migrate from pipeline variables to pipeline inputs for better security](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/migrate-from-pipeline-variables-to-pipeline-inputs-for-better-security/) — Pipeline variables have long been a convenient way to customize GitLab CI/CD pipelines at runtime. However, as CI/CD security best practices have evolved, we've recognized the need for stronger controls around pipeline customization. Unrestricted pipeline variables allow any users with pipeline trigger permissions to override values without validation or type checking. Beyond security considerations, pipeline variables lack proper documentation and explicit declaration, making it difficult to understand what inputs are expected and how they're used throughout your pipeline. This can lead to maintenance challenges and make it harder to establish proper governance over your CI/CD processes. Enter pipeline inputs Instead of relying on pipeline variables, we strongly recommend using GitLab's pipeline inputs feature. Pipeline inputs provide: Explicit declaration : Inputs must be explicitly declared in your .gitlab-ci.yml and are self-documented. Type safety : Support for different input types (string, boolean, number, array) Built-in validation : Automatic validation of input values Better security : No risk of variable injection attacks — only the declared inputs can be passed from the
- [Modernize Java applications quickly with GitLab Duo with Amazon Q](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/modernize-java-applications-quickly-with-gitlab-duo-with-amazon-q/) — Upgrading applications to newer, supported versions of Java has traditionally been a tedious and time-consuming process. Development teams must spend countless hours learning about deprecated APIs, updated libraries, and new language features. In many cases, significant code rewrites are necessary, turning what should be a straightforward upgrade into a multi-week project that diverts resources from building new features. GitLab Duo with Amazon Q changes this paradigm entirely with AI-powered automation. What once took weeks can now be accomplished in minutes, with full traceability and ready-to-review merge requests that maintain your application's functionality while leveraging modern Java features. How it works: Upgrade your Java application Let's walk through how you can modernize a Java 8 application to Java 17. Start with an issue First, create an issue in your GitLab project describing your modernization goal. You don't need to specify version details - GitLab Duo with Amazon Q is able to detect that your application is currently built with Java 8 and needs to be upgraded. Simply describe that you want to refactor your code to Java 17 in the issue title and description. Trig
- [Delivering faster and smarter scans with Advanced SAST](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/delivering-faster-and-smarter-scans-with-advanced-sast/) — Static application security testing (SAST) is critical to building secure software, helping teams identify vulnerabilities in code before they can be exploited. Last year, with GitLab 17.4, we launched Advanced SAST to deliver higher-quality scan results directly in developer workflows. Since then, Advanced SAST has powered millions of scans across over a hundred thousand codebases, reducing risk and helping customers build more secure applications from the start. We’re building on that foundation with a set of performance enhancements designed to improve accuracy and speed, so developers get results they can trust, without losing their flow. New capabilities include better out-of-the-box precision, the ability to add custom detection rules, and a trio of improvements to accelerate scan times through multi-core scanning, algorithmic optimizations, and diff-based scanning. Together, these improvements make Advanced SAST smarter and faster, delivering security that’s developer-friendly by design. SAST adoption hinges on both accuracy and speed Most SAST programs rarely fail due to inaccurate vulnerability detection; they fail because developers don’t adopt security tooling. Too often
- [GitLab 18.5: Intelligence that moves software development forward](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/gitlab-18-5-intelligence-that-moves-software-development-forward/) — Software development teams are drowning in noise. Thousands of vulnerabilities flood security dashboards, but only a fraction pose real risk. Developers context-switch between planning backlogs, triaging security findings, reviewing code, and responding to CI/CD failures — losing hours to manual work. GitLab 18.5 calms this chaos. At the heart of this release is a valuable improvement in overall usability of GitLab and how AI integrates into your user experience. A new panel-based UI makes it easier to see data in context, and allows GitLab Duo Chat to be persistently visible across the platform, wherever it is needed. Purpose-built agents tackle vulnerability triage and backlog management, and popular AI tools integrate with agentic workflows even more seamlessly than before. We’ve also extended our market-leading security capabilities to help you better identify exploitable vulnerabilities versus theoretical ones, distinguish active credentials from expired ones, and scan only changed code to keep developers in flow. What’s new in 18.5 18.5 represents our biggest release so far this year — watch our introduction to the release, and read more details below. &lt;div style=&quot;pad
- [Variable and artifact sharing in GitLab parent-child pipelines](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/variable-and-artifact-sharing-in-gitlab-parent-child-pipelines/) — Software projects have different evolving needs and requirements. Some have said that software is never finished, merely abandoned . Some software projects are small and others are large with complex integrations. Some have dependencies on external projects, while others are self-contained. Regardless of the size and complexity, the need to validate and ensure functionality remains paramount. CI/CD pipelines can help with the challenge of building and validating software projects consistently, but, much like the software itself, these pipelines can become complex with many dependencies. This is where ideas like parent-child pipelines and data exchange in CI/CD setups become incredibly important. In this article, we will cover common CI/CD data exchange challenges users may encounter with parent-child pipelines in GitLab — and how to solve them. You'll learn how to turn complex CI/CD processes into more manageable setups. Using parent-child pipelines The pipeline setup in the image below illustrates a scenario where a project could require a large, complex pipeline. The whole project resides in one repository and contains different modules. Each module requires its own set of build 
- [How we built a structured Streamlit Application Framework in Snowflake](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/how-we-built-a-structured-streamlit-application-framework-in-snowflake/) — Recently, the GitLab Data team transformed scattered Streamlit applications into a unified, secure, and scalable solution for our Snowflake environment. To accomplish this, we packed Python, Snowflake, and Streamlit together with GitLab. Follow along on this journey and discover the results we achieved, and learn how you can, too. The challenge Imagine this scenario: Your organization has dozens of Streamlit applications across different environments, running various Python versions, connecting to sensitive data with inconsistent security practices. Some apps work, others break mysteriously, and nobody knows who built what or how to maintain them. This was exactly the challenge our data team faced. Applications were being created in isolation, with no standardization, no security oversight, and no clear deployment process. The result? A compliance nightmare and a maintenance burden that was growing exponentially. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Functional architectural design (high level)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt; How we started We leveraged our unique position as customer zero by building this entire framework on GitLab's own CI/CD infrastructure and project management t
- [Streamline enterprise artifact management with GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/streamline-enterprise-artifact-management-with-gitlab/) — For the past six years, I've worked on artifact management at GitLab and have had hundreds of conversations with platform engineers trying to solve the same challenge: managing artifacts when they've become a sprawling, expensive mess. What started as simple Docker registries and Maven repositories has evolved into a complex web of tools, policies, and operational overhead that's consuming more time and budget than anyone anticipated. I recently spoke with a platform engineer at a Fortune 500 company who told me, &quot;I spend more time managing artifact repositories than I do on actual platform improvements.&quot; That conversation reminded me why we need an honest discussion about the real costs of fragmented artifact management — and what platform teams can realistically do about it. This article will help you better understand the problem and how GitLab can help you solve it through strategic consolidation. Real-world impact: The numbers Based on data from our customers and industry research, fragmented artifact management typically results in the following costs for a midsize organization (500+ developers): Licensing: $50,000-200,000 annually across multiple tools Operational 
- [Atlassian ending Data Center as GitLab maintains deployment choice](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/atlassian-ending-data-center-as-gitlab-maintains-deployment-choice/) — Change is never easy, especially when it's not your choice. Atlassian's announcement that all Data Center products will reach end-of-life by March 28, 2029 , means thousands of organizations must now reconsider their DevSecOps deployment and infrastructure. But you don't have to settle for deployment options that don't fit your needs. GitLab maintains your freedom to choose — whether you need self-managed for compliance, cloud for convenience, or hybrid for flexibility — all within a single AI-powered DevSecOps platform that respects your requirements. While other vendors force migrations to cloud-only architectures, GitLab remains committed to supporting the deployment choices that match your business needs. Whether you're managing sensitive government data, operating in air-gapped environments, or simply prefer the control of self-managed deployments, we understand that one size doesn't fit all. The cloud isn't the answer for everyone For the many companies that invested millions of dollars in Data Center deployments, including those that migrated to Data Center after its Server products were discontinued , this announcement represents more than a product sunset. It signals a fun
