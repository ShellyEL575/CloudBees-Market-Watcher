- [<![CDATA[Show HN: Paarvai – Infrastructure context for LLM-based DevOps agents]]>](https://paarvai.app) — I have been trying to get LLMs to handle real infra/DevOps tasks, and the biggest issue is that they don’t have reliable context. Infra is deeply interconnected, one misconfig can break a system.So I built Paarvai.
It connects to your cloud and IaC (read-only), builds a dependency graph, and gives LLMs the full picture of how everything is mapped and configured.Unlike tools that make on-the-fly calls (like Amazon Q), Paarvai stores the whole state and all relationships upfront, so agents or tools like Cursor/Claude/GPT can do things like:1. Understand dependencies (“What depends on this SQS queue?”)
2. Identify breakage (“Will disabling this Lambda break an API route?”)
3. Generate IaC with full context (“Write Terraform for this component using my current infra.”)We just launched the MVP with AWS support.I’m looking for early users, completely free.
If you try it and want something added, I will personally integrate your feature requests.Link: https://paarvai.appHappy to share details or answer questions.

- [Show HN: CodeProt – Filter static analysis false positives in CI](https://codeprot.com) — Hi HN, I'm the creator of CodeProt.
I got tired of reviewing 50 files just to find 3 indentation errors and missing the actual bugs buried in the noise. Traditional linters are great, but they often lack context, leading to a flood of false positives or trivial issues that clutter the PR review process.
CodeProt solves this by connecting to your CI pipeline (GitHub Actions). It parses the raw output from your existing static analysis tools, compares it against the diff, and uses a context-aware LLM check to filter out false positives and irrelevant noise before they reach your PR comments.
It's built to be a lightweight layer on top of your existing tools, not a replacement.
Business Model: Free for open source projects, paid tier for private repositories and teams.
Roast my code / Feedback welcome.

- [Ask YN: What CI do you use instead of GitHub Actions?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46103040) — When the Zig project moved from GitHub to Codeberg (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46064571), one of the reasons they listed was that "Actions has inexcusable bugs while being completely neglected." (from https://ziglang.org/news/migrating-from-github-to-codeberg/, internal links not copied because I'm being lazy). They did not go into detail about which CI solution they plan to switch to. As I'm starting to get annoyed with GitHub Actions myself and looking for alternatives, I had been hoping to hear their experience with an alternative, but I didn't get that.So I'd like to ask HN: if you don't use GitHub Actions, what CI solution did you end up choosing? And what has been your experience with it so far? Finally, if you have also used GitHub Actions, how would you compare your current CI solution to GitHub Actions in terms of pros and cons?P.S. Something with a free tier or a self-hosting option are the only viable options for me, but that doesn't mean I don't want to hear about your experience if you're on a commercial CI solution.

- [Show HN: Auto-Unpublish NPM Packages Published Outside CI](https://github.com/telophasehq/tangent-plugins/tree/main/detections/sha1hulud/npmcicorrelation) — A lot of vendors and open-source projects shared guidance on protecting users from downloading malicious NPM packages after the Shai-Hulud campaign — but almost nothing focused on protecting maintainers from accidentally (or maliciously) publishing them.So we built a small tool that continuously monitors your NPM packages and automatically unpublishes any version not produced by your CI workflow.

- [Show HN: Orkera: An MCP tool that handles deployment and back end infra](https://orkera.com/) — Hey HN, we’re Maya and Riles, and we’ve been working on Orkera (orkera.com); an MCP tool that lets you create and manage backend infrastructure through prompts. It handles database creation/management, deployments, cron jobs, and environment setup, all via MCP calls from your coding agent.Demo video: https://youtu.be/runSblXCYD0Why we built it:
We’re part of the startup community in Paris and kept seeing the same bottleneck: people can build a frontend or MVP quickly (especially with Cursor/Claude/Gemini), but the moment they want to share it with users, they hit DevOps friction: setting up a VM, creating a database, configuring deployment, choosing a domain, etc.We wanted to make that step disappear.
So we built Orkera: an MCP-based backend layer that tools like Cursor, Claude Code, and Gemini CLI can call to create infra and deploy apps automatically.What it does today:
- create and manage databases,
- deploy web apps without cloud setup,
- handle cron-like scheduled jobs,
- manage environments through MCP
All from inside your vibecoding tool.What we’re looking for:
This is the first public version (after some early feedback cycles) and we’d love testers who can tell us what’s missing, what feels weird, and what should be more transparent or configurable.Setup:
Getting Orkera running is simple; register to get an API key, then add the MCP endpoint to your editor. We published small setup guides for Cursor, Claude Code, and Gemini CLI on orkera.com.Thanks for taking a look, and we’d appreciate feedback, criticism, and suggestions.

- [<p>Migrating from Azure DevOps to GitLab can seem like a daunting task, but with the right approach ](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/migration-from-azure-devops-to-gitlab/) — Migrating from Azure DevOps to GitLab can seem like a daunting task, but with the right approach and tools, it can be a smooth and efficient process. This guide will walk you through the steps needed to successfully migrate your projects, repositories, and pipelines from Azure DevOps to GitLab.
Overview
GitLab provides both Congregate (maintained by GitLab Professional Services organization) and a built-in Git repository import for migrating projects from Azure DevOps (ADO). These options support repository-by-repository or bulk migration and preserve git commit history, branches, and tags. With Congregate and professional services tools, we support additional assets such as wikis, work items, CI/CD variables, container images, packages, pipelines, and more (see this feature matrix). Use this guide to plan and execute your migration and complete post-migration follow-up tasks.
Enterprises migrating from ADO to GitLab commonly follow a multi-phase approach:


Migrate repositories from ADO to GitLab using Congregate or GitLab's built-in repository migration.


Migrate pipelines from Azure Pipelines to GitLab CI/CD.


Migrate remaining assets such as boards, work items, and artifacts to GitLab Issues, Epics, and the Package and Container Registries.

Planning your migration
To plan your migration, ask these questions:


How soon do we need to complete the migration?


Do we understand what will be migrated?


Who will run the migration?


What organizational structure do we want in GitLab?


Are there any constraints, limitations, or pitfalls that need to be taken into account?


Determine your timeline, as it will largely dictate your migration approach. Identify champions or groups familiar with both ADO and GitLab platforms (such as early adopters) to help drive adoption and provide guidance.
Inventory what you need to migrate:


The number of repositories, pull requests, and contributors


The number and complexity of work items and pipelines


Repository sizes and dependency relationships


Critical integrations and runner requirements (agent pools with specific capabilities)


Use GitLab Professional Services's Evaluate tool to produce a complete inventory of your entire Azure DevOps organization, including repositories, PR counts, contributor lists, number of pipelines, work items, CI/CD variables and more. If you're working with the GitLab Professional Services team, share this report with your engagement manager or technical architect to help plan the migration.
Migration timing is primarily driven by pull request count, repository size, and amount of contributions (e.g. comments in PR, work items, etc). For example, 1,000 small repositories with few PRs and limited contributors can migrate much faster than a smaller set of repositories containing tens of thousands of PRs and thousands of contributors. Use your inventory data to estimate effort and plan test runs before proceeding with production migrations.
Compare inventory against your desired timeline and decide whether to migrate all repositories at once or in batches. If teams cannot migrate simultaneously, batch and stagger migrations to align with team schedules. For example, in Professional Services engagements, we organize migrations into waves of 200-300 projects to manage complexity and respect API rate limits, both in GitLab and ADO.
GitLab's built-in repository importer migrates Git repositories (commits, branches, and tags) one-by-one. Congregate is designed to preserve pull requests (known in GitLab as merge requests), comments, and related metadata where possible; the simple built-in repository import focuses only on the Git data (history, branches, and tags).
Items that typically require separate migration or manual recreation:


Azure Pipelines - create equivalent GitLab CI/CD pipelines (consult with CI/CD YAML and/or with CI/CD components). Alternatively, consider using AI-based pipeline conversion available in Congregate.


Work items and boards - map to GitLab Issues, Epics, and Issue Boards.


Artifacts, container images (ACR) - migrate to GitLab Package Registry or Container Registry.


Service hooks and external integrations - recreate in GitLab.


Permissions models differ between ADO and GitLab; review and plan permissions mapping rather than assuming exact preservation.


Review what each tool (Congregate vs. built-in import) will migrate and choose the one that fits your needs. Make a list of any data or integrations that must be migrated or recreated manually.
Who will run the migration?
Migrations are typically run by a GitLab group owner or instance administrator, or by a designated migrator who has been granted the necessary permissions on the destination group/project. Congregate and the GitLab import APIs require valid authentication tokens for both Azure DevOps and GitLab.


Decide whether a group owner/admin will perform the migrations or whether you will grant a specific team/person delegated access.


Ensure the migrator has correctly configured personal access tokens (Azure DevOps and GitLab) with the scopes required by your chosen migration tool (for example, api/read_repository scopes and any tool-specific requirements).


Test tokens and permissions with a small pilot migration.


Note: Congregate leverages file-based import functionality for ADO migrations and requires instance administrator permissions to run (see our documentation). If you are migrating to GitLab.com, consider engaging Professional Services. For more information, see the Professional Services Full Catalog. Non-admin account cannot preserve contribution attribution!
What organizational structure do we want in GitLab?
While it's possible to map ADO structure directly to GitLab structure, it's recommended to rationalize and simplify the structure during migration. Consider how teams will work in GitLab and design the structure to facilitate collaboration and access management. Here is a way to think about mapping ADO structure to GitLab structure:
graph TD
    subgraph GitLab
        direction TB
        A["Top-level Group"]
        B["Subgroup (optional)"]
        C["Projects"]
        A --> B
        A --> C
        B --> C
    end

    subgraph AzureDevOps["Azure DevOps"]
        direction TB
        F["Organizations"]
        G["Projects"]
        H["Repositories"]
        F --> G
        G --> H
    end

    style A fill:#FC6D26
    style B fill:#FC6D26
    style C fill:#FC6D26
    style F fill:#8C929D
    style G fill:#8C929D
    style H fill:#8C929D

Recommended approach:


Map each ADO organization to a GitLab group (or a small set of groups), not to many small groups. Avoid creating a GitLab group for every ADO team project. Use migration as an opportunity to rationalize your GitLab structure.


Use subgroups and project-level permissions to group related repositories.


Manage access to sets of projects by using GitLab groups and group membership (groups and subgroups) rather than one group per team project.


Review GitLab permissions and consider SAML Group Links to implement an enterprise RBAC model for your GitLab instance (or a GitLab.com namespace).


ADO Boards and work items: State of migration
It's important to understand how work items migrate from ADO into GitLab Plan (issues, epics, and boards).


ADO Boards and work items map to GitLab Issues, Epics, and Issue Boards. Plan how your workflows and board configurations will translate.


ADO Epics and Features become GitLab Epics.


Other work item types (e.g., user stories, tasks, bugs) become project-scoped issues.


Most standard fields are preserved; selected custom fields can be migrated when supported.


Parent-child relationships are retained so Epics reference all related issues.


Links to pull requests are converted to merge request links to maintain development traceability.


Example: Migration of an individual work item to a GitLab Issue, including field accuracy and relationships:

Batching guidance:


If you need to run migrations in batches, use your new group/subgroup structure to define batches (for example, by ADO organization or by product area).


Use inventory reports to drive batch selection and test each batch with a pilot migration before scaling.


Pipelines migration
Congregate recently introduced AI-powered conversion for multi-stage YAML pipelines from Azure DevOps to GitLab CI/CD. This automated conversion works best for simple, single-file pipelines and is designed to provide a working starting point rather than a production-ready .gitlab-ci.yml file. The tool generates a functionally equivalent GitLab pipeline that you can then refine and optimize for your specific needs.


Converts Azure Pipelines YAML to .gitlab-ci.yml format automatically.


Best suited for straightforward, single-file pipeline configurations.


Provides a boilerplate to accelerate migration, not a final production artifact.


Requires review and adjustment for complex scenarios, custom tasks, or enterprise requirements.


Does not support Azure DevOps classic release pipelines — convert these to multi-stage YAML first.


Repository owners should review the GitLab CI/CD documentation to further optimize and enhance their pipelines after the initial conversion.
Example of converted pipelines:

# azure-pipelines.yml

trigger:
  - main

variables:
  imageName: myapp

stages:
  - stage: Build
    jobs:
      - job: Build

Final checklist:


Decide timeline and batch strategy.


Produce a full inventory of repositories, PRs, and contributors.


Choose Congregate or the built-in import based on scope (PRs and metadata vs. Git data only).


Decide who will run migrations and ensure tokens/permissions are configured.


Identify assets that must be migrated separately (pipelines, work items, artifacts, and hooks) and plan those efforts.


Run pilot migrations, validate results, then scale according to your plan.


Running your migrations
After planning, execute migrations in stages, starting with trial runs. Trial migrations help surface org-specific issues early and let you measure duration, validate outcomes, and fine-tune your approach before production.
What trial migrations validate:


Whether a given repository and related assets migrate successfully (history, branches, tags; plus MRs/comments if using Congregate)


Whether the destination is usable immediately (permissions, runners, CI/CD variables, integrations)


How long each batch takes, to set schedules and stakeholder expectations


Downtime guidance:


GitLab's built-in Git import and Congregate do not inherently require downtime.


For production waves, freeze changes in ADO (branch protections or read-only) to avoid missed commits, PR updates, or work items created mid-migration.


Trial runs do not require freezes and can be run anytime.


Batching guidance:


Run trial batches back-to-back to shorten elapsed time; let teams validate results asynchronously.


Use your planned group/subgroup structure to define batches and respect API rate limits.


Recommended steps:

Create a test destination in GitLab for trials:



GitLab.com: create a dedicated group/namespace (for example, my-org-sandbox)


Self-managed: create a top-level group or a separate test instance if needed



Prepare authentication:



Azure DevOps PAT with required scopes.


GitLab Personal Access Token with api and read_repository (plus admin access for file-based imports used by Congregate).



Run trial migrations:



Repos only: use GitLab's built-in import (Repo by URL)


Repos + PRs/MRs and additional assets: use Congregate



Post-trial follow-up:



Verify repo history, branches, tags; merge requests (if migrated), issues/epics (if migrated), labels, and relationships.


Check permissions/roles, protected branches, required approvals, runners/tags, variables/secrets, integrations/webhooks.


Validate pipelines (.gitlab-ci.yml) or converted pipelines where applicable.




Ask users to validate functionality and data fidelity.


Resolve issues uncovered during trials and update your runbooks.


Network and security:



If your destination uses IP allow lists, add the IPs of your migration host and any required runners/integrations so imports can succeed.


Run production migrations in waves:



Enforce change freezes in ADO during each wave.


Monitor progress and logs; retry or adjust batch sizes if you hit rate limits.



Optional: remove the sandbox group or archive it after you finish.

- [<p>Embedded systems development teams face a persistent challenge: maintaining development velocity ](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/automate-embedded-systems-compliance-with-gitlab-and-codesonar/) — Embedded systems development teams face a persistent challenge: maintaining development velocity while meeting stringent functional safety and code quality requirements. Standards like ISO 26262, IEC 62304, DO-178C, and IEC 61508 demand rigorous verification processes that are often manual and time-consuming. Compliance reviews against coding standards like MISRA C/C++, isolated scanning workflows, and post-development verification create bottlenecks. Teams are forced to choose between speed and safety.
GitLab's integration with CodeSonar (from AdaCore) addresses this challenge by automating compliance workflows and enabling continuous verification throughout the development lifecycle.
Specialized scanning for safety-critical systems
Safety-critical systems require deep analysis of C/C++ code compiled with specialized embedded tools. These systems must demonstrate compliance with coding standards (MISRA C/C++, CERT C/C++, AUTOSAR C++) and functional safety frameworks (ISO 26262, DO-178C, IEC 61508) that require detailed evidence trails. Beyond aligning with coding standards, teams also need to address security concerns. This means testing for memory problems as well as a host of other problems like uninitialized variables and command injection.
CodeSonar performs whole program analysis with specialized scanning capabilities for these standards. Pairing CodeSonar with GitLab enables teams to automate compliance workflows and maintain comprehensive audit trails throughout the development lifecycle.
Automating compliance from commit to merge
The GitLab and CodeSonar integration provides a compliance-as-code approach that automates policy enforcement from the earliest stages of development. CodeSonar functions as an additional scanner within GitLab CI/CD pipelines, analyzing code in every commit and merge request.
Because CodeSonar was purpose-built for embedded systems, it performs deep control flow and data flow analysis across entire programs, identifying vulnerabilities like buffer overruns, data taint, uninitialized variables, use-after-free conditions, and command injection — the root causes of most security incidents in embedded systems.
The integration works through GitLab's CI/CD configuration. When developers push code changes, the pipeline triggers CodeSonar scanning. For C and C++ firmware, CodeSonar observes compiler invocations during the actual build process, creating an internal representation of the code that enables sophisticated analysis. Results are converted from SARIF format to GitLab's Static Application Security Testing (SAST) format and surfaced directly in merge requests, where they feed into GitLab Ultimate's Security Dashboard, Vulnerability Management, and Compliance Frameworks.
Example workflow: ISO 26262 ASIL-D compliance
The demo video below shows the complete workflow for an embedded system subject to ISO 26262 ASIL-D requirements. The scenario illustrates how embedded development teams can implement continuous compliance without compromising development velocity.
<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1139086924?badge=0&autopause=0&player_id=0&app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="Automated Compliance for Embedded Systems using GitLab and CodeSonar"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>`
The workflow begins with a developer submitting a merge request for firmware changes. GitLab's CI/CD pipeline automatically triggers CodeSonar scanning, which performs deep C/C++ analysis against custom ISO 26262 policies configured in the pipeline. When CodeSonar identifies an ASIL-D relevant vulnerability, the pipeline halts automatically per the compliance policy, with clear documentation explaining the issue. The complete scan results, issue tracking, and approval workflow are maintained in GitLab as a single source of truth for audit trails.
Developers can use both the CodeSonar hub interface and GitLab Duo AI to understand the vulnerability. CodeSonar provides detailed information about the path through the source code that leads to the problem, along with code navigation features to isolate the root cause. GitLab Duo explains the vulnerability and provides specific remediation recommendations. After the developer implements the fix and validates the resolution, the code merges successfully with full compliance evidence automatically collected throughout the process.
Benefits of the integration
Organizations implementing this integrated compliance with GitLab and CodeSonar will see significant improvements in both development velocity and compliance confidence.


Efficiency gains: Development teams reduce time-to-market by catching coding standard compliance issues early when they're less expensive to fix. Automated security policy enforcement decreases manual security review overhead, freeing specialists to focus on complex problems rather than routine checks. Audit readiness improves through automated evidence collection. Compliance artifacts are generated as a by-product of normal development rather than through separate documentation efforts.


Compliance maturity: This integrated approach helps organizations maintain continuous compliance with industry standards and regulations. By embedding verification into every code change, teams build comprehensive audit trails that demonstrate adherence to ISO 26262, DO-178C, MISRA C/C++, and other requirements. The automated workflow transforms compliance from a periodic checkpoint into an ongoing verification process.


Implementation considerations
Implementing the GitLab and CodeSonar integration requires access to GitLab Ultimate, a CodeSonar hub, GitLab runners where code can be compiled and analyzed, and appropriate mechanisms for managing analysis data files. Both GitLab and CodeSonar fully support on-premises and air-gapped environments and can be deployed to auto-scalable cloud environments as well.
Teams should configure Custom Compliance Frameworks in GitLab to define specific policies for their relevant standards: ISO 26262 for automotive, DO-178C for aerospace, IEC 62304 for medical devices, and others. These frameworks enable automated enforcement of compliance requirements through merge request approval rules, vulnerability thresholds, and scan policy gates.
Get started
The CodeSonar GitLab CI component is available through GitLab's CI/CD Catalog. Detailed integration documentation provides platform-specific setup instructions for Linux, Docker, and Windows environments. For organizations evaluating this solution, the implementation demonstrates how specialized embedded systems tools can integrate with a modern DevSecOps platform to deliver both development velocity and compliance rigor.
