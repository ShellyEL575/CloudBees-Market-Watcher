- [<![CDATA[Show HN: Paarvai – Infrastructure context for LLM-based DevOps agents]]>](https://paarvai.app) — I have been trying to get LLMs to handle real infra/DevOps tasks, and the biggest issue is that they don’t have reliable context. Infra is deeply interconnected, one misconfig can break a system.So I built Paarvai.
It connects to your cloud and IaC (read-only), builds a dependency graph, and gives LLMs the full picture of how everything is mapped and configured.Unlike tools that make on-the-fly calls (like Amazon Q), Paarvai stores the whole state and all relationships upfront, so agents or tools like Cursor/Claude/GPT can do things like:1. Understand dependencies (“What depends on this SQS queue?”)
2. Identify breakage (“Will disabling this Lambda break an API route?”)
3. Generate IaC with full context (“Write Terraform for this component using my current infra.”)We just launched the MVP with AWS support.I’m looking for early users, completely free.
If you try it and want something added, I will personally integrate your feature requests.Link: https://paarvai.appHappy to share details or answer questions.

- [Show HN: CodeProt – Filter static analysis false positives in CI](https://codeprot.com) — Hi HN, I'm the creator of CodeProt.
I got tired of reviewing 50 files just to find 3 indentation errors and missing the actual bugs buried in the noise. Traditional linters are great, but they often lack context, leading to a flood of false positives or trivial issues that clutter the PR review process.
CodeProt solves this by connecting to your CI pipeline (GitHub Actions). It parses the raw output from your existing static analysis tools, compares it against the diff, and uses a context-aware LLM check to filter out false positives and irrelevant noise before they reach your PR comments.
It's built to be a lightweight layer on top of your existing tools, not a replacement.
Business Model: Free for open source projects, paid tier for private repositories and teams.
Roast my code / Feedback welcome.

- [Ask YN: What CI do you use instead of GitHub Actions?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46103040) — When the Zig project moved from GitHub to Codeberg (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46064571), one of the reasons they listed was that "Actions has inexcusable bugs while being completely neglected." (from https://ziglang.org/news/migrating-from-github-to-codeberg/, internal links not copied because I'm being lazy). They did not go into detail about which CI solution they plan to switch to. As I'm starting to get annoyed with GitHub Actions myself and looking for alternatives, I had been hoping to hear their experience with an alternative, but I didn't get that.So I'd like to ask HN: if you don't use GitHub Actions, what CI solution did you end up choosing? And what has been your experience with it so far? Finally, if you have also used GitHub Actions, how would you compare your current CI solution to GitHub Actions in terms of pros and cons?P.S. Something with a free tier or a self-hosting option are the only viable options for me, but that doesn't mean I don't want to hear about your experience if you're on a commercial CI solution.

- [Show HN: Auto-Unpublish NPM Packages Published Outside CI](https://github.com/telophasehq/tangent-plugins/tree/main/detections/sha1hulud/npmcicorrelation) — A lot of vendors and open-source projects shared guidance on protecting users from downloading malicious NPM packages after the Shai-Hulud campaign — but almost nothing focused on protecting maintainers from accidentally (or maliciously) publishing them.So we built a small tool that continuously monitors your NPM packages and automatically unpublishes any version not produced by your CI workflow.

- [Show HN: Orkera: An MCP tool that handles deployment and back end infra](https://orkera.com/) — Hey HN, we’re Maya and Riles, and we’ve been working on Orkera (orkera.com); an MCP tool that lets you create and manage backend infrastructure through prompts. It handles database creation/management, deployments, cron jobs, and environment setup, all via MCP calls from your coding agent.Demo video: https://youtu.be/runSblXCYD0Why we built it:
We’re part of the startup community in Paris and kept seeing the same bottleneck: people can build a frontend or MVP quickly (especially with Cursor/Claude/Gemini), but the moment they want to share it with users, they hit DevOps friction: setting up a VM, creating a database, configuring deployment, choosing a domain, etc.We wanted to make that step disappear.
So we built Orkera: an MCP-based backend layer that tools like Cursor, Claude Code, and Gemini CLI can call to create infra and deploy apps automatically.What it does today:
- create and manage databases,
- deploy web apps without cloud setup,
- handle cron-like scheduled jobs,
- manage environments through MCP
All from inside your vibecoding tool.What we’re looking for:
This is the first public version (after some early feedback cycles) and we’d love testers who can tell us what’s missing, what feels weird, and what should be more transparent or configurable.Setup:
Getting Orkera running is simple; register to get an API key, then add the MCP endpoint to your editor. We published small setup guides for Cursor, Claude Code, and Gemini CLI on orkera.com.Thanks for taking a look, and we’d appreciate feedback, criticism, and suggestions.

- [Show HN: OriGen – A Deterministic Workflow Compiler (Maps → IR → CI/K8s)](https://origen-hub.github.io/origen-core-public/) — OriGen is a deterministic workflow compiler.It takes declarative Maps (YAML) and produces a backend-neutral
Intermediate Representation (Route). Guides then translate the IR
into native execution artifacts: Kubernetes Jobs, CI configs, or
local container scripts.The key properties:• Deterministic planning (no execution during compilation)• Digest-pinned toolchains (Navigators)• Immutable resource bundles (Backpacks)• Planning/execution separation• Backend neutrality (K8s first, others follow)• Zero-trust emerges as architecture (no hidden behavior)• Automatic Digital Provenance (ADP) falls out of determinismOriGen does *not* run workflows. It compiles them.The goal is to provide a stable planning layer above CI/CD,
orchestrators, and container engines: one Map → many backends.Documentation (Primer, Architecture, Zero-Trust, ADP):
https://origen-hub.github.io/origen-core-public/This release is documentation-only (v0.0.1). IR and schema
prototypes are next. Early architectural feedback is welcome.

After spending more time than I wanted, and bugging lovely people at Forgejo's matrix, I came up with this:https://wkoszek.github.io/easyforgejo/With this script, you should get Forgejo installed on your Linux computer in 2min. I tested this on a VM for now, and it works well enough for beta launch.Repo is here:https://github.com/wkoszek/easyforgejoLet me know what you think and submit PRs if you find bugs. I'd not use it in production just yet.

With Congregate and professional services tools, we support additional assets such as wikis, work items, CI/CD variables, container images, packages, pipelines, and more (see this feature matrix). Use this guide to plan and execute your migration and complete post-migration follow-up tasks.
Enterprises migrating from ADO to GitLab commonly follow a multi-phase approach:


Migrate repositories from ADO to GitLab using Congregate or GitLab's built-in repository migration.


Migrate pipelines from Azure Pipelines to GitLab CI/CD.


Migrate remaining assets such as boards, work items, and artifacts to GitLab Issues, Epics, and the Package and Container Registries.

Planning your migration
To plan your migration, ask these questions:


How soon do we need to complete the migration?


Do we understand what will be migrated?


Who will run the migration?


What organizational structure do we want in GitLab?


Are there any constraints, limitations, or pitfalls that need to be taken into account?


Determine your timeline, as it will largely dictate your migration approach. Identify champions or groups familiar with both ADO and GitLab platforms (such as early adopters) to help drive adoption and provide guidance.
Inventory what you need to migrate:


The number of repositories, pull requests, and contributors


The number and complexity of work items and pipelines


Repository sizes and dependency relationships


Critical integrations and runner requirements (agent pools with specific capabilities)


Use GitLab Professional Services's Evaluate tool to produce a complete inventory of your entire Azure DevOps organization, including repositories, PR counts, contributor lists, number of pipelines, work items, CI/CD variables and more. If you're working with the GitLab Professional Services team, share this report with your engagement manager or technical architect to help plan the migration.
Migration timing is primarily driven by pull request count, repository size, and amount of contributions (e.g. comments in PR, work items, etc). For example, 1,000 small repositories with few PRs and limited contributors can migrate much faster than a smaller set of repositories containing tens of thousands of PRs and thousands of contributors. Use your inventory data to estimate effort and plan test runs before proceeding with production migrations.
Compare inventory against your desired timeline and decide whether to migrate all repositories at once or in batches. If teams cannot migrate simultaneously, batch and stagger migrations to align with team schedules. For example, in Professional Services engagements, we organize migrations into waves of 200-300 projects to manage complexity and respect API rate limits, both in GitLab and ADO.
GitLab's built-in repository importer migrates Git repositories (commits, branches, and tags) one-by-one. Congregate is designed to preserve pull requests (known in GitLab as merge requests), comments, and related metadata where possible; the simple built-in repository import focuses only on the Git data (history, branches, and tags).
Items that typically require separate migration or manual recreation:


Azure Pipelines - create equivalent GitLab CI/CD pipelines (consult with CI/CD YAML and/or with CI/CD components). Alternatively, consider using AI-based pipeline conversion available in Congregate.


Work items and boards - map to GitLab Issues, Epics, and Issue Boards.


Artifacts, container images (ACR) - migrate to GitLab Package Registry or Container Registry.


Service hooks and external integrations - recreate in GitLab.


Permissions models differ between ADO and GitLab; review and plan permissions mapping rather than assuming exact preservation.


Review what each tool (Congregate vs. built-in import) will migrate and choose the one that fits your needs. Make a list of any data or integrations that must be migrated or recreated manually.
Who will run the migration?
Migrations are typically run by a GitLab group owner or instance administrator, or by a designated migrator who has been granted the necessary permissions on the destination group/project. Congregate and the GitLab import APIs require valid authentication tokens for both Azure DevOps and GitLab.


Decide whether a group owner/admin will perform the migrations or whether you will grant a specific team/person delegated access.


Ensure the migrator has correctly configured personal access tokens (Azure DevOps and GitLab) with the scopes required by your chosen migration tool (for example, api/read_repository scopes and any tool-specific requirements).


Test tokens and permissions with a small pilot migration.


Note: Congregate leverages file-based import functionality for ADO migrations and requires instance administrator permissions to run (see our documentation). If you are migrating to GitLab.com, consider engaging Professional Services. For more information, see the Professional Services Full Catalog. Non-admin account cannot preserve contribution attribution!
What organizational structure do we want in GitLab?
While it's possible to map ADO structure directly to GitLab structure, it's recommended to rationalize and simplify the structure during migration. Consider how teams will work in GitLab and design the structure to facilitate collaboration and access management. Here is a way to think about mapping ADO structure to GitLab structure:
graph TD
    subgraph GitLab
        direction TB
        A["Top-level Group"]
        B["Subgroup (optional)"]
        C["Projects"]
        A --> B
        A --> C
        B --> C
    end

    subgraph AzureDevOps["Azure DevOps"]
        direction TB
        F["Organizations"]
        G["Projects"]
        H["Repositories"]
        F --> G
        G --> H
    end

    style A fill:#FC6D26
    style B fill:#FC6D26
    style C fill:#FC6D26
    style F fill:#8C929D
    style G fill:#8C929D
    style H fill:#8C929D

Recommended approach:


Map each ADO organization to a GitLab group (or a small set of groups), not to many small groups. Avoid creating a GitLab group for every ADO team project. Use migration as an opportunity to rationalize your GitLab structure.


Use subgroups and project-level permissions to group related repositories.


Manage access to sets of projects by using GitLab groups and group membership (groups and subgroups) rather than one group per team project.


Review GitLab permissions and consider SAML Group Links to implement an enterprise RBAC model for your GitLab instance (or a GitLab.com namespace).


ADO Boards and work items: State of migration
It's important to understand how work items migrate from ADO into GitLab Plan (issues, epics, and boards).


ADO Boards and work items map to GitLab Issues, Epics, and Issue Boards. Plan how your workflows and board configurations will translate.


ADO Epics and Features become GitLab Epics.


Other work item types (e.g., user stories, tasks, bugs) become project-scoped issues.


Most standard fields are preserved; selected custom fields can be migrated when supported.


Parent-child relationships are retained so Epics reference all related issues.


Links to pull requests are converted to merge request links to maintain development traceability.


Example: Migration of an individual work item to a GitLab Issue, including field accuracy and relationships:

Batching guidance:


If you need to run migrations in batches, use your new group/subgroup structure to define batches (for example, by ADO organization or by product area).


Use inventory reports to drive batch selection and test each batch with a pilot migration before scaling.


Pipelines migration
Congregate recently introduced AI-powered conversion for multi-stage YAML pipelines from Azure DevOps to GitLab CI/CD. This automated conversion works best for simple, single-file pipelines and is designed to provide a working starting point rather than a production-ready .gitlab-ci.yml file. The tool generates a functionally equivalent GitLab pipeline that you can then refine and optimize for your specific needs.


Converts Azure Pipelines YAML to .gitlab-ci.yml format automatically.


Best suited for straightforward, single-file pipeline configurations.


Provides a boilerplate to accelerate migration, not a final production artifact.


Requires review and adjustment for complex scenarios, custom tasks, or enterprise requirements.


Does not support Azure DevOps classic release pipelines — convert these to multi-stage YAML first.


Repository owners should review the GitLab CI/CD documentation to further optimize and enhance their pipelines after the initial conversion.
Example of converted pipelines:

# azure-pipelines.yml

trigger:
  - main

variables:
  imageName: myapp

stages:
  - stage: Build
    jobs:
      - job: Build
        pool:

Final checklist:


Decide timeline and batch strategy.


Produce a full inventory of repositories, PRs, and contributors.


Choose Congregate or the built-in import based on scope (PRs and metadata vs. Git data only).


Decide who will run migrations and ensure tokens/permissions are configured.


Identify assets that must be migrated separately (pipelines, work items, artifacts, and hooks) and plan those efforts.


Run pilot migrations, validate results, then scale according to your plan.


Running your migrations
After planning, execute migrations in stages, starting with trial runs. Trial migrations help surface org-specific issues early and let you measure duration, validate outcomes, and fine-tune your approach before production.
What trial migrations validate:


Whether a given repository and related assets migrate successfully (history, branches, tags; plus MRs/comments if using Congregate)


Whether the destination is usable immediately (permissions, runners, CI/CD variables, integrations)


How long each batch takes, to set schedules and stakeholder expectations


Downtime guidance:


GitLab's built-in Git import and Congregate do not inherently require downtime.


For production waves, freeze changes in ADO (branch protections or read-only) to avoid missed commits, PR updates, or work items created mid-migration.


Trial runs do not require freezes and can be run anytime.


Batching guidance:


Run trial batches back-to-back to shorten elapsed time; let teams validate results asynchronously.


Use your planned group/subgroup structure to define batches and respect API rate limits.


Recommended steps:

Create a test destination in GitLab for trials:



GitLab.com: create a dedicated group/namespace (for example, my-org-sandbox)


Self-managed: create a top-level group or a separate test instance if needed



Prepare authentication:



Azure DevOps PAT with required scopes.


GitLab Personal Access Token with api and read_repository (plus admin access for file-based imports used by Congregate).



Run trial migrations:



Repos only: use GitLab's built-in import (Repo by URL)


Repos + PRs/MRs and additional assets: use Congregate



Post-trial follow-up:



Verify repo history, branches, tags; merge requests (if migrated), issues/epics (if migrated), labels, and relationships.


Check permissions/roles, protected branches, required approvals, runners/tags, variables/secrets, integrations/webhooks.


Validate pipelines (.gitlab-ci.yml) or converted pipelines where applicable.




Ask users to validate functionality and data fidelity.


Resolve issues uncovered during trials and update your runbooks.


Network and security:



If your destination uses IP allow lists, add the IPs of your migration host and any required runners/integrations so imports can succeed.


Run production migrations in waves:



Enforce change freezes in ADO during each wave.


Monitor progress and logs; retry or adjust batch sizes if you hit rate limits.



Optional: remove the sandbox group or archive it after you finish.

- [<p>Embedded systems development teams face a persistent challenge: maintaining development velocity ](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/automate-embedded-systems-compliance-with-gitlab-and-codesonar/) — Embedded systems development teams face a persistent challenge: maintaining development velocity while meeting stringent functional safety and code quality requirements. Standards like ISO 26262, IEC 62304, DO-178C, and IEC 61508 demand rigorous verification processes that are often manual and time-consuming. Compliance reviews against coding standards like MISRA C/C++, isolated scanning workflows, and post-development verification create bottlenecks. Teams are forced to choose between speed and safety.
GitLab's integration with CodeSonar (from AdaCore) addresses this challenge by automating compliance workflows and enabling continuous verification throughout the development lifecycle.
Specialized scanning for safety-critical systems
Safety-critical systems require deep analysis of C/C++ code compiled with specialized embedded tools. These systems must demonstrate compliance with coding standards (MISRA C/C++, CERT C/C++, AUTOSAR C++) and functional safety frameworks (ISO 26262, DO-178C, IEC 61508) that require detailed evidence trails. Beyond aligning with coding standards, teams also need to address security concerns. This means testing for memory problems as well as a host of other problems like uninitialized variables and command injection.
CodeSonar performs whole program analysis with specialized scanning capabilities for these standards. Pairing CodeSonar with GitLab enables teams to automate compliance workflows and maintain comprehensive audit trails throughout the development lifecycle.
Automating compliance from commit to merge
The GitLab and CodeSonar integration provides a compliance-as-code approach that automates policy enforcement from the earliest stages of development. CodeSonar functions as an additional scanner within GitLab CI/CD pipelines, analyzing code in every commit and merge request.
Because CodeSonar was purpose-built for embedded systems, it performs deep control flow and data flow analysis across entire programs, identifying vulnerabilities like buffer overruns, data taint, uninitialized variables, use-after-free conditions, and command injection — the root causes of most security incidents in embedded systems.
The integration works through GitLab's CI/CD configuration. When developers push code changes, the pipeline triggers CodeSonar scanning. For C and C++ firmware, CodeSonar observes compiler invocations during the actual build process, creating an internal representation of the code that enables sophisticated analysis. Results are converted from SARIF format to GitLab's Static Application Security Testing (SAST) format and surfaced directly in merge requests, where they feed into GitLab Ultimate's Security Dashboard, Vulnerability Management, and Compliance Frameworks.
Example workflow: ISO 26262 ASIL-D compliance
The demo video below shows the complete workflow for an embedded system subject to ISO 26262 ASIL-D requirements. The scenario illustrates how embedded development teams can implement continuous compliance without compromising development velocity.
<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1139086924?badge=0&autopause=0&player_id=0&app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="Automated Compliance for Embedded Systems using GitLab and CodeSonar"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>`
The workflow begins with a developer submitting a merge request for firmware changes. GitLab's CI/CD pipeline automatically triggers CodeSonar scanning, which performs deep C/C++ analysis against custom ISO 26262 policies configured in the pipeline. When CodeSonar identifies an ASIL-D relevant vulnerability, the pipeline halts automatically per the compliance policy, with clear documentation explaining the issue. The complete scan results, issue tracking, and approval workflow are maintained in GitLab as a single source of truth for audit trails.
Developers can use both the CodeSonar hub interface and GitLab Duo AI to understand the vulnerability. CodeSonar provides detailed information about the path through the source code that leads to the problem, along with code navigation features to isolate the root cause. GitLab Duo explains the vulnerability and provides specific remediation recommendations. After the developer implements the fix and validates the resolution, the code merges successfully with full compliance evidence automatically collected throughout the process.
Benefits of the integration
Organizations implementing this integrated compliance with GitLab and CodeSonar will see significant improvements in both development velocity and compliance confidence.


Efficiency gains: Development teams reduce time-to-market by catching coding standard compliance issues early when they're less expensive to fix. Automated security policy enforcement decreases manual security review overhead, freeing specialists to focus on complex problems rather than routine checks. Audit readiness improves through automated evidence collection. Compliance artifacts are generated as a by-product of normal development rather than through separate documentation efforts.


Compliance maturity: This integrated approach helps organizations maintain continuous compliance with industry standards and regulations. By embedding verification into every code change, teams build comprehensive audit trails that demonstrate adherence to ISO 26262, DO-178C, MISRA C/C++, and other requirements. The automated workflow transforms compliance from a periodic checkpoint into an ongoing verification process.


Implementation considerations
Implementing the GitLab and CodeSonar integration requires access to GitLab Ultimate, a CodeSonar hub, GitLab runners where code can be compiled and analyzed, and appropriate mechanisms for managing analysis data files. Both GitLab and CodeSonar fully support on-premises and air-gapped environments and can be deployed to auto-scalable cloud environments as well.
Teams should configure Custom Compliance Frameworks in GitLab to define specific policies for their relevant standards: ISO 26262 for automotive, DO-178C for aerospace, IEC 62304 for medical devices, and others. These frameworks enable automated enforcement of compliance requirements through merge request approval rules, vulnerability thresholds, and scan policy gates.
Get started
The CodeSonar GitLab CI component is available through GitLab's CI/CD Catalog. Detailed integration documentation provides platform-specific setup instructions for Linux, Docker, and Windows environments. For organizations evaluating this solution, the implementation demonstrates how specialized embedded systems tools can integrate with a modern DevSecOps platform to deliver both development velocity and compliance rigor.

- [<p>Every day, GitLab deploys code changes to the world's largest GitLab instance — GitLab.com  — up ](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/continuously-deploying-the-largest-gitlab-instance/) — Every day, GitLab deploys code changes to the world's largest GitLab instance — GitLab.com  — up to 12 times without any downtime. We use GitLab's own CI/CD platform to manage these deployments, which impact millions of developers worldwide. This deployment frequency serves as our primary quality gate and stress test. It also means our customers get access to new features within hours of development rather than waiting weeks or months. When organizations depend on GitLab for their DevOps workflows, they're using a platform that's proven at scale on our own infrastructure. In this article, you'll learn how we built an automated deployment pipeline using core GitLab CI/CD functionality to handle this deployment complexity.
The business case for deployment velocity
For GitLab: Our deployment frequency isn't just an engineering metric — it's a business imperative. Rapid deployment cycles mean we can respond to customer feedback within hours, ship security patches immediately, and validate new features in production before scaling them.
For our customers: Every deployment to GitLab.com validates the deployment practices we recommend to our users. When you use GitLab's deployment features, you're using the same battle-tested approach that handles millions of git operations, CI/CD pipelines, and user interactions daily. You benefit from:

Latest features available immediately: New capabilities reach you within hours of completion, not in quarterly release cycles
Proven reliability at scale: If a feature works on GitLab.com, you can trust it in your environment
Full value of GitLab: Zero-downtime deployments mean you never lose access to your DevOps platform, even during updates
Real-world tested practices: Our deployment documentation isn't theory — it's exactly how we run the largest GitLab instance in existence

Code flow architecture
Our deployment pipeline follows a structured progression through multiple stages, each acting as a checkpoint on the journey from code proposal to production deployment.

      B --> C[Pipeline Triggered]

          L --> M[Main Environment]

      end

Deployment pipeline makeup
Our deployment approach uses GitLab's native CI/CD capabilities to orchestrate complex deployments across hybrid infrastructure.
Here's how we do it.
Build
Building GitLab is a complex topic in and of itself, so I'll go over the details at a high level.
We build both our Omnibus package and our Cloud Native GitLab (CNG) images. The Omnibus packages deploy to our Gitaly fleet (our Git storage layer), while CNG images run all other components as containerized workloads. Other stateful services like Postgres and Redis have grown so large we have dedicated teams managing them separately. For GitLab.com, those systems are not deployed during our Auto-Deploy procedures.
We have a scheduled pipeline that will regularly look at gitlab-org/gitlab and search for the most recent commit on the default branch with a successful (“green”) pipeline. Green pipelines signal that every component of GitLab has passed its comprehensive test suite. We then create an auto-deploy branch from that commit.
This triggers a sequence of events: primarily, the need to build this package and all components that are a part of our monolith.
Another scheduled pipeline selects the latest built package and initiates the deployment pipeline. Procedurally, it looks this simple:
  graph LR
      A[Create branch] --> B[Build]
      B --> C[Choose Built package]
      C --> D[Start Deploy Pipeline]

Building takes some time, and since deployments can vary due to various circumstances, we choose the latest build to deploy. We technically build more versions of GitLab for .com than will ever be deployed. This enables us to always have a package lined up ready to go, and this brings us the closest we can be to having a full continuously delivered product for .com.
Environment-based validation and Canary strategy
Quality assurance (QA) isn't just an afterthought here — it's baked into every layer from development through deployment. Our QA process leverages automated test suites that include unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests that simulate real user interactions with GitLab's features. But more importantly for our deployment pipeline, our QA process works hand-in-hand with our Canary strategy through environment-based validation.
As part of our validation approach, we leverage GitLab's native Canary deployments, enabling controlled validation of changes with limited traffic exposure before full production deployment. We send roughly 5% of all traffic through our Canary stage. This approach increases the complexity of database migrations, but successfully navigating Canary deployments ensures we deploy a reliable product seamlessly.
The Canary deployment features you use in GitLab were refined through managing one of the most complex deployment scenarios in production. When you implement Canary deployments for your applications, you're using patterns proven at massive scale.
Our deployment process follows a progressive rollout strategy:


Staging Canary: Initial validation environment


Production Canary: Limited production traffic


Staging Main: Full staging environment deployment


Production Main: Full production rollout

Our QA validation occurs at multiple checkpoints throughout this progressive deployment process: after each Canary deployment, and again after post-deploy migrations. This multilayered approach ensures that each phase of our deployment strategy has its own safety net. You can learn more about GitLab's comprehensive testing approach in our handbook.
Deployment pipeline
Here are the challenges we address across our deployment pipeline.
Technical architecture considerations
GitLab.com represents real-world deployment complexity at scale. As the largest known GitLab instance, deployments use our official GitLab Helm chart and the official Linux package — the same artifacts our customers use. You can learn more about the GitLab.com architecture in our handbook. This hybrid approach means our deployment pipeline must intelligently handle both containerized services and traditional Linux services in the same deployment cycle.
Dogfooding at scale: We deploy using the same procedures we document for zero-downtime upgrades. If something doesn't work smoothly for us, we don't recommend it to customers. This self-imposed constraint drives continuous improvement in our deployment tooling.
The following stages are run for all environment and stage upgrades:
  graph LR
      a[prep] --> c[Regular Migrations - Canary stage only]
      a --> f[Assets - Canary stage only]
      c --> d[Gitaly]
      d --> k8s

      subgraph subGraph0["VM workloads"]
        d["Gitaly"]
      end

      subgraph subGraph1["Kubernetes workloads"]
        k8s["k8s"]
      end

      subgraph fleet["fleet"]
        subGraph0
        subGraph1
      end

Stage details:


Prep: Validates deployment readiness and performs pre-deployment checks


Migrations: Executes database regular migrations. This only happens during the Canary stage. Because both Canary and Main stages share the same database, these changes are already available when the Main stage deploys, eliminating the need to repeat these tasks.


Assets: We leverage a GCS bucket for all static assets. If any new assets are created, we upload these to our bucket such that they are immediately available to our Canary stage. As we leverage WebPack for assets, and properly leverage SHAs in the naming of our assets, we can confidently not worry that we override an older asset. Therefore, old assets continue to be available for older deployments and new assets are imemdiately made available when Canary begins its deploy. This only happens during the Canary stage deployment. Because Canary and Main stages share the same asset storage, these changes are already available when the Main stage deploys.


Gitaly: Updates Gitaly Virtual Machine storage layer via our Omnibus Linux package on each Gitaly node. This service is unique as we bundle it with git. Therefore, we need to ensure that this service is capable of atomic upgrades. We leverage a wrapper around Gitaly, which enables us to install a newer version of Gitaly and make use of the library tableflip to cleanly rotate the running Gitaly, ensuring high availability of this service on each of our instances.


Kubernetes: Deploys containerized GitLab components via our Helm chart. Note that we deploy to numerous clusters spread across Zones for redundancy, so these are usually broken into their own stages to minimize harm and sometimes allows us to stop mid-deploy if critical issues are detected.


Multi-version compatibility: The hidden challenge
As you read our process, you will notice that there's a period of time where our database schema is ahead of the code that the Main stage knows about. This happens because the Canary stage has already deployed new code and runs regular database migrations, but the Main stage is still running the previous version of the code that doesn't know about these new database changes.
Real-world example: Imagine we're adding a new merge_readiness field to merge requests. During deployment, some servers are running code that expects this field. while others don't know it exists yet. If we handle this poorly, we break GitLab.com for millions of users. If we handle it well, nobody notices anything happened.
This occurs with most other services, as well. For example, if a client sends multiple requests, there's a chance one of them might land in our Canary stage; other requests might be directed to the Main stage. This is not too different from a deploy as it does take a decent amount of time to roll through the few thousand Pods that run our services.
With a few exceptions, the vast majority of our services will run a slightly newer version of that component in Canary for a period of time. In a sense, these scenarios are all transient states. But they can often persist for several hours or days in a live, production environment. Therefore, we must treat them with the same care as permanent states. During any deployment, we have multiple versions of GitLab running simultaneously and they all need to play nicely together.
Database operations
Database migrations present a unique challenge in our Canary deployment model. We need schema changes to support new features while maintaining our ability to roll back if issues arise. Our solution involves careful separation of concerns:


Regular migrations: Run during the Canary stage, designed to be backward-compatible, consists of only reversible changes


Post-deploy migrations: The "point of no return" migrations that happen only after multiple successful deployments


Database changes are handled with precision and extensive validation procedures:
  graph LR
      A[Regular Migrations] --> B[Canary Stage Deploy]
      B --> C[Main Stage Deploy]
      C --> D[Post Deploy Migrations]


Post-deploy migrations
GitLab deployments involve many components. Updating GitLab is not atomic, so many components must be backward-compatible.
Post-deploy migrations often contain changes that can't be easily rolled back — think data transformations, column drops, or structural changes that would break older code versions. By running them after we've gained confidence through multiple successful deployments, we ensure:


The new code is stable and we're unlikely to need a rollback


Performance characteristics are well understood in production


Any edge cases have been discovered and addressed


The blast radius is minimized if something does go wrong


This approach provides the optimal balance: enabling rapid feature deployment through Canary releases while maintaining rollback capabilities until we have high confidence in deployment stability.
The expand-migrate-contract pattern: Our database, frontend, and application compatibility changes follow a carefully orchestrated three-phase approach.


Expand: Add new structures (columns, indexes) while keeping old ones functional


Migrate: Deploy new application code that uses the new structures


Contract: Remove old structures in post-deploy migrations after everything is stable


Real-world example: When adding a new merge_readiness column to merge requests:


Expand: Add the new column with a default value; existing code ignores it


Migrate: Deploy code that reads and writes to the new column while still supporting the old approach


3 Contract: After several successful deployments, remove the old column in a post-deploy migration
All database operations, application code, frontend code, and more, are subject to a set of guidelines that Engineering must adhere to, which can be found in our Multi-Version Compatibility documentation.

Key takeaways for engineering teams
GitLab's deployment pipeline represents a sophisticated system that balances deployment velocity with operational reliability. The progressive deployment model, comprehensive testing integration, and robust rollback capabilities provide a foundation for reliable software delivery at scale.
For engineering teams implementing similar systems, key considerations include:


Automated testing: Comprehensive test coverage throughout the deployment pipeline


Progressive rollout: Staged deployments to minimize risk and enable rapid recovery


Monitoring integration: Comprehensive observability across all deployment stages


Incident response: Rapid detection and resolution capabilities for deployment issues


GitLab's architecture demonstrates how modern CI/CD systems can manage the complexity of large-scale deployments while maintaining the velocity required for competitive software development.
Important note on scope
This article specifically covers the deployment pipeline for services that are part of the GitLab Omnibus package and Helm chart — essentially the core GitLab monolith and its tightly integrated components.
However, GitLab's infrastructure landscape extends beyond what's described here. Other services, notably our AI services and services that might be in a proof of concept state, follow a different deployment approach using our internal platform called Runway.
If you're working with or curious about these other services, you can find more information in the Runway documentation.
Other offerings, such as GitLab Dedicated are deployed more in alignment with what we expect customers to be capable of performing themselves by way of the GitLab Environment Toolkit. If you'd like to learn more, check out the GitLab Environment Toolkit project.
The deployment strategies, architectural considerations, and pipeline complexities outlined in this article represent the battle-tested approach we use for our core platform — but like any large engineering organization, we have multiple deployment strategies tailored to different service types and maturity levels.
