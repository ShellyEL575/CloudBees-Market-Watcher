- [Show HN: Importguard – Measure and enforce Python import-time behavior in CI](https://github.com/AryanKumar1401/importguard) — I built a CLI tool to catch slow imports and sneaky side effects before they ship to production.The problem: Python imports can quietly become a performance trap. Your CLI takes 2 seconds to show --help because importing your package pulls in pandas. Or worse, importing a module makes network calls or writes files as a side effect.Importguard uses Python's -X importtime flag to measure exactly how long each import takes, then lets you:- Set time budgets: `importguard check mypkg --max-ms 200`
- Ban heavy imports: `importguard check mypkg.cli --ban pandas --ban torch`
- Get reliable timing: `--repeat 5` runs multiple times and reports median
- Configure per-module rules in `.importguard.toml`It runs in an isolated subprocess so it doesn't pollute your interpreter, and outputs JSON for CI integration.Use cases:
- Keep CLI startup snappy
- Prevent serverless cold start regressions (Lambda/Cloud Functions)
- Ensure library hygiene (don't force users to install heavy deps)pip install importguardpyGitHub: https://github.com/AryanKumar1401/importguardHappy to hear feedback on what would make this more useful!

Your CLI takes 2 seconds to show --help because importing your package pulls in pandas. Or worse, importing a module makes network calls or writes files as a side effect.Importguard uses Python's -X importtime flag to measure exactly how long each import takes, then lets you:- Set time budgets: `importguard check mypkg --max-ms 200`
- Ban heavy imports: `importguard check mypkg.cli --ban pandas --ban torch`
- Get reliable timing: `--repeat 5` runs multiple times and reports median
- Configure per-module rules in `.importguard.toml`It runs in an isolated subprocess so it doesn't pollute your interpreter, and outputs JSON for CI integration.Use cases:
- Keep CLI startup snappy
- Prevent serverless cold start regressions (Lambda/Cloud Functions)
- Ensure library hygiene (don't force users to install heavy deps)pip install importguardpyGitHub: https://github.com/AryanKumar1401/importguardHappy to hear feedback on what would make this more useful!
