- [Show HN: Auto-Unpublish NPM Packages Published Outside CI](https://github.com/telophasehq/tangent-plugins/tree/main/detections/sha1hulud/npmcicorrelation) — <p>A lot of vendors and open-source projects shared guidance on protecting users from downloading malicious NPM packages after the Shai-Hulud campaign — but almost nothing focused on protecting maintainers from accidentally (or maliciously) publishing them.<p>So we built a small tool that continuously monitors your NPM packages and automatically unpublishes any version not produced by your CI workflow.</p>

- [Show HN: Orkera: An MCP tool that handles deployment and back end infra](https://orkera.com/) — <p>Hey HN, we’re Maya and Riles, and we’ve been working on Orkera (orkera.com); an MCP tool that lets you create and manage backend infrastructure through prompts. It handles database creation/management, deployments, cron jobs, and environment setup, all via MCP calls from your coding agent.<p>Demo video: <a href="https://youtu.be/runSblXCYD0" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/runSblXCYD0</a><p>Why we built it:
We’re part of the startup community in Paris and kept seeing the same bottleneck: people can build a frontend or MVP quickly (especially with Cursor/Claude/Gemini), but the moment they want to share it with users, they hit DevOps friction: setting up a VM, creating a database, configuring deployment, choosing a domain, etc.<p>We wanted to make that step disappear.
So we built Orkera: an MCP-based backend layer that tools like Cursor, Claude Code, and Gemini CLI can call to create infra and deploy apps automatically.<p>What it does today:
- create and manage databases,
- deploy web apps without cloud setup,
- handle cron-like scheduled jobs,
- manage environments through MCP
All from inside your vibecoding tool.<p>What we’re looking for:
This is the first public version (after some early feedback cycles) and we’d love testers who can tell us what’s missing, what feels weird, and what should be more transparent or configurable.<p>Setup:
Getting Orkera running is simple; register to get an API key, then add the MCP endpoint to your editor. We published small setup guides for Cursor, Claude Code, and Gemini CLI on orkera.com.<p>Thanks for taking a look, and we’d appreciate feedback, criticism, and suggestions.</p>

- [Show HN: MemBrowse - CI/CD memory footprint tracking for embedded firmware](https://membrowse.com) — <p>Built this after working with Intel’s Bluetooth firmware team - we kept seeing builds suddenly fail because memory crept up a few bytes at a time until it overflowed. Then everyone lost hours/days bisecting symbols and linker maps to figure out which commit pushed it over.<p>So I made a CI tool that tracks firmware memory footprint across commits and flags bloat before it breaks the build.<p>How it works:<p>CLI parses ELF + DWARF, extracts per-section/per-symbol/per-file size info<p>CI uploads reports; the platform stores history and generates diffs<p>Shows exactly what changed between commits (what grew, where, and by how much)<p>Optional memory budgets via commit keywords (acts as a CI gate to block regressions)<p>The report generator is open source: <a href="https://github.com/membrowse/membrowse-action" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/membrowse/membrowse-action</a><p>Works with GitHub Actions or any CI, tested on ARM, ESP32, ARC, x86 (multiple toolchains).<p>There’s also a live demo analyzing MicroPython firmware builds at membrowse.com.<p>Curious to hear from embedded folks:
* How do you track code size / memory usage today?<p>* What would stop you from adding this type of check to CI?<p>* What’s missing that would make this genuinely useful for your workflow?</p>

## 📈 Trends
- [Show HN: OriGen – A Deterministic Workflow Compiler (Maps → IR → CI/K8s)](https://origen-hub.github.io/origen-core-public/) — <p>OriGen is a deterministic workflow compiler.<p>It takes declarative Maps (YAML) and produces a backend-neutral
Intermediate Representation (Route). Guides then translate the IR
into native execution artifacts: Kubernetes Jobs, CI configs, or
local container scripts.<p>The key properties:<p>• Deterministic planning (no execution during compilation)<p>• Digest-pinned toolchains (Navigators)<p>• Immutable resource bundles (Backpacks)<p>• Planning/execution separation<p>• Backend neutrality (K8s first, others follow)<p>• Zero-trust emerges as architecture (no hidden behavior)<p>• Automatic Digital Provenance (ADP) falls out of determinism<p>OriGen does *not* run workflows. It compiles them.<p>The goal is to provide a stable planning layer above CI/CD,
orchestrators, and container engines: one Map → many backends.<p>Documentation (Primer, Architecture, Zero-Trust, ADP):
<a href="https://origen-hub.github.io/origen-core-public/" rel="nofollow">https://origen-hub.github.io/origen-core-public/</a><p>This release is documentation-only (v0.0.1). IR and schema
prototypes are next. Early architectural feedback is welcome.</p>
