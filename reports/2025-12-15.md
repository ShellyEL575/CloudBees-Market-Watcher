- [<p>Today we are thrilled to announce the release of GitLab product documentation in Japanese at <a h](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/how-we-built-and-automated-our-new-japanese-gitlab-docs-site/) — Today we are thrilled to announce the release of GitLab product documentation in Japanese at docs.gitlab.com/ja-jp. This major step marks our first move toward making GitLab's extensive documentation accessible to our users worldwide.

The unique challenge of the Japanese market
Japan represents one of the world's largest economies and is a critical market for enterprise software. However, it also presents a distinctive challenge: despite its technological sophistication and massive developer community, English proficiency remains a significant barrier for many users.
Japan's developers and DevSecOps teams often face challenges with English-only documentation, as indicated by the country's ranking on the EF English Proficiency Index. This language barrier can significantly impact the speed of learning and ultimately influence the decision to evaluate, adopt, and champion a platform within Japanese organizations.
We've heard directly from our Japanese customers and partners that English-only documentation wasn't merely an inconvenience, it was a barrier preventing them from getting the most out of GitLab. The impact rippled through every stage of the user journey: From initial evaluation where teams struggled to assess GitLab's capabilities, to daily operations where finding solutions took longer than necessary, to staying current with new features and best practices.
In a market as competitive and mature as in Japan, this language barrier directly affected GitLab's market penetration. When Japanese companies evaluate enterprise software, the availability of comprehensive Japanese documentation signals long-term commitment to the market. It demonstrates that a provider isn't just making a token effort, but is genuinely invested in supporting Japanese users throughout their entire journey.
To address this challenge and demonstrate our commitment to the Japanese market, we built localization infrastructure from the ground up, integrating with how we create and maintain documentation at GitLab.
Localization built on docs-as-code principles
GitLab's documentation is treated like any other code contribution, residing alongside product code in GitLab projects and managed via merge requests. This system ensures documentation is version-controlled, collaboratively reviewed, and automatically tested through CI/CD pipelines, which includes checks for issues with language, formatting, and links. Both the English and Japanese documentation sites are dynamically generated using the Hugo static site generator and deployed after merging changes, guaranteeing users always access the latest information.
The documentation is extensive and comprehensive, drawing content from various source projects, including GitLab, GitLab Runner, Omnibus GitLab, GitLab Charts, GitLab Operator, and GitLab CLI (glab) (see architecture for details). This sheer scale and rapid update velocity presented a significant localization challenge. To keep pace with the continuous evolution of these source English projects, we had to design a localization infrastructure for our GitLab product documentation that could handle these unique complexities and provide an enterprise-grade solution for a fully localized site, all while adhering to our CI/CD pipeline requirements.
How we localized GitLab Documentation
For our initial Japanese localization, we adopted a strategy of integrating new folders within our existing English content structure. Specifically, we introduced doc-locale/ja-jp folders within each project that stores source Markdown files. This architecture keeps the translations right alongside their source content while maintaining a clear organizational separation. Not only that, but it also enables us to apply the same robust version control, established review and collaboration workflows, and even some of the automated quality checks used for our English documentation to the translated content.
This internationalization infrastructure built for Japanese documentation provides a scalable foundation for future language expansion. With the architecture, tooling, and processes now in place, we are well-positioned to support additional languages as we continue our commitment to making GitLab accessible to users worldwide.
An AI-assisted  translation workflow that balances speed and quality
We adopted a strategic, phased approach to processing the content through translation, prioritizing pages based on their English-language page views. The highest-traffic pages underwent AI translation first, followed by comprehensive human linguistic review, and we intentionally paused subsequent phases until these priority pages completed the full human review cycle. This deliberate sequencing allowed us to build a robust, curated translation memory and termbase from our most important content. These linguistic assets accelerated and improved quality across all remaining content. In parallel, this initial phase served as our testing ground on the technical infrastructure on the GitLab side. We used it to iterate and reinforce our CI/CD pipelines, refine our translation and post-editing AI scripts, and solidify our Translation MR review process.
To provide our international users with the most current documentation while guaranteeing high-quality translated content, we implemented an AI-assisted translation workflow with human post-editing, consisting of:

Phase 1: AI-powered translation. We built a custom AI translation system enriched with GitLab-specific context including style guides, GitLab UI content translations, terminology databases, and original file context. This system intelligently handles GitLab's specialized markdown syntax (GLFM) and protects elements like placeholder variables, alert boxes, Hugo shortcodes, and GitLab-specific references that standard translation tools can't process out of the box.
Phase 2: Human linguistic review. Professional Japanese translators specialized in technical content then review and refine the AI translations. They work with GitLab's Japanese style guide, translation memory, and terminology database to ensure accuracy, natural language flow, and cultural appropriateness. These human-reviewed translations progressively replace the AI versions on the site.

Technical challenges and solutions
Localizing GitLab's extensive documentation, while maintaining our docs-as-code principles and CI/CD-driven publishing workflow, required significant technical innovation. The challenges extended beyond translation itself: we needed to preserve complex markdown syntax, maintain automated testing standards, ensure seamless content fallbacks, and create sustainable processes for continuous updates across multiple source projects.
The English markdown file syntax complexity led us to developing custom code and regex in our Translation Management System (TMS) to protect codeblocks, URLs, and other functional elements that should not be exposed for translation.

Due to the dynamics of how the English content is generated, we established an English fallback mechanism. Essentially, when the Japanese translation is not ready yet, the localized site seamlessly displays English content with translated navigation and UI, preventing 404s and maintaining language context via Hugo’s rendering system.
We enhanced the localized navigation and linking so that it adjusts dynamically and would persist the locale. We added anchor IDs in the translated files by pre-processing the English file before it’s sent for translation. That improves the experience for people navigating to a docs page from a link. The consistent anchor ID means they can change to either language and still land in the correct place in the page.

We also extended CI/CD pipelines to test localized content in Translation MRs following the same quality standards as the English docs. It allows us to catch invalid Hugo shortcodes, spaces inside links, or bare URLs. It also identifies orphaned files and redirects files with no target files. You can see the jobs that run on the MRs containing translated documentation on the GitLab project  .gitlab/ci/docs.gitlab-ci.yml file.
A centralized translation request system orchestrates the workflow, monitors the English files, identifies new and updated content, routes files for translation, automatically creates translation merge requests, tracks file status in translation requests and maintains an audit trail. To get docs translated we processed 430 Translation MRs with files ranging from 1-10 in each Translation MR.

The result is a Japanese documentation experience that stays synchronized with English content updates, giving users faster access to critical information. Users can discover and navigate content fully in their language, with English appearing only for content that’s still in translation. They can trust GitLab’s quality standards while accessing the latest features quickly. All of this creates a sustainable, scalable foundation for future languages and documentation growth.

- [Show HN: Paarvai – Infrastructure context for LLM-based DevOps agents](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46142123) — I have been trying to get LLMs to handle real infra/DevOps tasks, and the biggest issue is that they don’t have reliable context. Infra is deeply interconnected, one misconfig can break a system.So I built Paarvai.
It connects to your cloud and IaC (read-only), builds a dependency graph, and gives LLMs the full picture of how everything is mapped and configured.Unlike tools that make on-the-fly calls (like Amazon Q), Paarvai stores the whole state and all relationships upfront, so agents or tools like Cursor/Claude/GPT can do things like:1. Understand dependencies (“What depends on this SQS queue?”)
2. Identify breakage (“Will disabling this Lambda break an API route?”)
3. Generate IaC with full context (“Write Terraform for this component using my current infra.”)We just launched the MVP with AWS support.I’m looking for early users, completely free.
If you try it and want something added, I will personally integrate your feature requests.Link: https://paarvai.appHappy to share details or answer questions.

- [Show HN: CodeProt – Filter static analysis false positives in CI](https://codeprot.com) — Hi HN, I'm the creator of CodeProt.
I got tired of reviewing 50 files just to find 3 indentation errors and missing the actual bugs buried in the noise. Traditional linters are great, but they often lack context, leading to a flood of false positives or trivial issues that clutter the PR review process.
CodeProt solves this by connecting to your CI pipeline (GitHub Actions). It parses the raw output from your existing static analysis tools, compares it against the diff, and uses a context-aware LLM check to filter out false positives and irrelevant noise before they reach your PR comments.
It's built to be a lightweight layer on top of your existing tools, not a replacement.
Business Model: Free for open source projects, paid tier for private repositories and teams.
Roast my code / Feedback welcome.

## 📈 Trends
- [<p>Leading academic institutions face a critical challenge: how to provide thousands of students and](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/artois-university-elevates-curriculum-with-gitlab-ultimate-for-education/) — Leading academic institutions face a critical challenge: how to provide thousands of students and researchers with industry-standard, full-featured DevSecOps tools without compromising institutional control. Many start with basic version control, but the modern curriculum demands integrated capabilities for planning, security, and advanced CI/CD.
The GitLab for Education program is designed to solve this by providing access to GitLab Ultimate for qualifying institutions, allowing them to scale their operations and elevate their academic offerings.
This article showcases a powerful success story from the Centre de Recherche en Informatique de Lens (CRIL), a joint laboratory of Artois University and CNRS in France. After years of relying solely on GitLab Community Edition (CE), the university's move to GitLab Ultimate through the GitLab for Education program immediately unlocked advanced capabilities, transforming their teaching, research, and contribution workflows virtually overnight. This story demonstrates why GitLab Ultimate is essential for institutions seeking to deliver advanced computer science and research curricula.
GitLab Ultimate unlocked: Managing scale and driving academic value
Artois University's self-managed GitLab instance is a large-scale operation, supporting nearly 3,000 users across approximately 19,000 projects, primarily serving computer science students and researchers. While GitLab Community Edition was robust, the upgrade to GitLab Ultimate provided the sophisticated tooling necessary for managing this scale and facilitating advanced university-level work.
"We can see the difference," says Daniel Le Berre, head of research at CRIL and the instance maintainer. "It's a completely different product. Each week reveals new features that directly enhance our productivity and teaching."
The institution joined the GitLab for Education program specifically because it covers both instructional and non-commercial research use cases and offers full access to Ultimate's features, removing significant cost barriers.
Key GitLab Ultimate benefits for students and researchers


Advanced project management at scale: Master's students now benefit from GitLab Ultimate's project planning features. This enables them to structure, track, and manage complex, long-term research projects using professional methodologies like portfolio management and advanced issue tracking that seamlessly roll up across their thousands of projects.


Enhanced visibility: Features like improved dashboards and code previews directly in Markdown files dramatically streamline tracking and documentation review, reducing administrative friction for both instructors and students managing large project loads.


Comprehensive curriculum: From concepts to continuous delivery
GitLab Ultimate is deeply integrated into the computer science curriculum, moving students beyond simple git commands to practical DevSecOps implementation.


Git fundamentals: Students begin by visualizing concepts using open-source tools to master Git concepts.


Full CI/CD implementation: Students use GitLab CI for rigorous Test-Driven Development (TDD) in their software projects. They learn to build, test, and perform quality assurance using unit and integration testing pipelines—core competency made seamless by the integrated platform.


DevSecOps for research and documentation: The university teaches students that DevSecOps principles are vital for all collaborative work. Inspired by earlier work in Delft, students manage and produce critical research documentation (PDFs from Markdown files) using GitLab, incorporating quality checks like linters and spell checks directly in the CI pipeline. This ensures high-quality, reproducible research output.


Future-proofing security skills: The GitLab Ultimate platform immediately positions the institution to incorporate advanced DevSecOps features like SAST and DAST scanning as their research and development code projects grow, ensuring students are prepared for industry security standards.


Accelerating open source contributions with GitLab Duo
Access to the full GitLab platform, including our AI capabilities, has empowered students to make impactful contributions to the wider open source community faster than ever before.
Two Master's students recently completed direct contributions to the GitLab product, adding the ORCID identifier into user profiles. Working on GitLab.com, they leveraged GitLab Duo's AI chat and code suggestions to navigate the codebase efficiently.
"This would not have been possible without GitLab Duo," Daniel Le Berre notes. "The AI features helped students, who might have lacked deep codebase knowledge, deliver meaningful contributions in just two weeks."
This demonstrates how providing students with cutting-edge tools accelerates their learning and impact, allowing them to translate classroom knowledge into real-world contributions immediately.
Empowering open research and institutional control
The stability of the self-managed instance at Artois University is key to its success. This model guarantees institutional control and stability — a critical factor for long-term research preservation.
The institution's expertise in this area was recently highlighted in a major 2024 study led by CRIL, titled: "Higher Education and Research Forges in France - Definition, uses, limitations encountered and needs analysis" (Project on GitLab). The research found that the vast majority of public forges in French Higher Education and Research relied on GitLab. This finding underscores the consensus among academic leaders that self-hosted solutions are essential for data control and longevity, especially when compared to relying on external, commercial forges.

- [<p>Job seekers are being targeted by scammers impersonating recruiters at tech companies, including ](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/new-wave-of-fake-job-scams-impersonating-recruiters/) — Job seekers are being targeted by scammers impersonating recruiters at tech companies, including GitLab, through email, LinkedIn, and video conferencing platforms. These scams misuse GitLab’s name, logo, and team member identities to create the illusion of legitimate hiring activity.
Victims have reported receiving fake interview invitations, employment offers, and onboarding documents, often followed by requests for payment or personal information. These campaigns are not affiliated with GitLab in any way.
What’s new with this wave
Recent incidents differ from earlier scams by introducing new domains and tactics, including:


Use of unauthorized domains such as gitlab[.]careers and careers-gitlab[.]com


References to fake certifications like “CPD USA Certification”


Fake recruiter profiles on LinkedIn and Teams impersonating GitLab HR staff


Requests for sensitive information or upfront “equipment” payments after fake interviews


These impersonators are becoming more sophisticated, using corporate-style emails, authentic-looking offer letters, and realistic video interview invitations to gain trust.
Common warning signs
Candidates should be cautious if they encounter any of the following:


The email domain is not @gitlab.com (e.g., Gmail, Outlook, or lookalike domains).


The recruiter requests you to pay for equipment, certification, or background checks.


The communication happens only through chat, without verified GitLab calendar invites.


The job listing does not appear on the official GitLab careers page.


The recruiter refuses to verify their identity via a GitLab.com address or directs you to external URLs unrelated to GitLab.


GitLab’s official recruiting process
GitLab’s hiring process is fully remote but transparent and verifiable.


All communications come from official @gitlab.com email addresses.


Interviews are conducted via Zoom, not Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp.


GitLab never requests payment, purchases, or certification fees during recruitment.


Legitimate offers and onboarding steps are handled securely through GitLab systems.


For details on how we hire, please refer to our Candidate Handbook.
What GitLab is doing
GitLab’s Security and People teams are actively investigating and reporting fake recruiting domains and profiles to hosting providers and social networks. We continue to collaborate with legal, communications, and platform partners to remove fraudulent content and notify affected individuals.
If you see something suspicious, let us know at security@gitlab.com. Anyone can report suspicious recruiting activity for review by our Security Incident Response Team.
How to protect yourself
If you receive suspicious communication that claims to be from GitLab:


Verify the sender’s email domain — it should always end in @gitlab.com.


Confirm job postings directly on about.gitlab.com/jobs.


Avoid sending personal or financial information to unverified recruiters.


Report any suspicious domains or messages to security@gitlab.com.


For additional information on avoiding job scams, see these trusted resources:
