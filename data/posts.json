    "url": "https://buildbeacon.io",
    "summary": "Hey HN,I've been running GitHub Actions across a dozen repos for a few years now. My workflow was always the same: push code, switch to GitHub, click through each repo to check if builds passed, repeat. When something failed, I'd often find out late because I forgot to check.I looked at existing monitoring tools, but they all wanted OAuth access to my GitHub account. That meant giving them read access to my source code, build logs, secrets in environment variables, and everything else. For a dashboard that just shows me pass/fail status, that felt like way too much access.So I built BuildBeacon with a different approach: webhook-only architecture.How it works:Instead of connecting via OAuth, you add a webhook URL to your GitHub repo (or org). GitHub sends events to BuildBeacon when workflows run. That's it. We never make API calls to GitHub, so we never see your code, logs, or anything you don't explicitly send us.The tradeoff is that we can only show you what GitHub sends in webhook payloads—workflow name, status, duration, commit SHA, branch, actor. There is actually a lot of information. Everything that's needed to show all information without requiring access to any log contents or artifact data. For my use case (knowing if builds pass/fail across repos), that's exactly what I needed.What you get:- Dashboard showing workflow runs across all your repos- Different views: cards per repo, grid of individual runs, PR \ntracking, checks, deployments, releases and analytics- Team access to the same webhook dataTechnical details:- Frontend: Next.js 15- Backend: Django REST API with Ninja- Data stored in EU (I'm based in Europe, wanted to keep it simple for GDPR)- Webhook secrets are hashed, we verify signatures on incoming eventsTrying it out:You'll need to create an account to get a webhook URL. Free tier gives you 3 repos with 14-day data retention. Setup takes about 3 minutes—generate webhook URL, paste into GitHub repo settings, trigger a workflow.Limitations:- GitHub Actions only right now. Planning to add GitLab and others later based on interest.- No build log viewing (by design) but direct links to GitHub- No mobile app yetPricing:Free tier for small projects. Paid starts at $13/mo if you need more repos or longer retention.---Would appreciate any feedback, especially on:- Is the webhook-only approach a meaningful differentiator, or do most people not care about the OAuth access issue?- What's missing that would make this useful for your team?Happy to answer questions about the architecture or anything else.\n\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46539786\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

    "url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46539786",
    "summary": "Hey HN,I've been running GitHub Actions across a dozen repos for a few years now. My workflow was always the same: push code, switch to GitHub, click through each repo to check if builds passed, repeat. When something failed, I'd often find out late because I forgot to check.I looked at existing monitoring tools, but they all wanted OAuth access to my GitHub account. That meant giving them read access to my source code, build logs, secrets in environment variables, and everything else. For a dashboard that just shows me pass/fail status, that felt like way too much access.So I built BuildBeacon with a different approach: webhook-only architecture.How it works:Instead of connecting via OAuth, you add a webhook URL to your GitHub repo (or org). GitHub sends events to BuildBeacon when workflows run. That's it. We never make API calls to GitHub, so we never see your code, logs, or anything you don't explicitly send us.The tradeoff is that we can only show you what GitHub sends in webhook payloads—workflow name, status, duration, commit SHA, branch, actor. There is actually a lot of information. Everything that's needed to show all information without requiring access to any log contents or artifact data. For my use case (knowing if builds pass/fail across repos), that's exactly what I needed.What you get:- Dashboard showing workflow runs across all your repos- Different views: cards per repo, grid of individual runs, PR \ntracking, checks, deployments, releases and analytics- Team access to the same webhook dataTechnical details:- Frontend: Next.js 15- Backend: Django REST API with Ninja- Data stored in EU (I'm based in Europe, wanted to keep it simple for GDPR)- Webhook secrets are hashed, we verify signatures on incoming eventsTrying it out:You'll need to create an account to get a webhook URL. Free tier gives you 3 repos with 14-day data retention. Setup takes about 3 minutes—generate webhook URL, paste into GitHub repo settings, trigger a workflow.Limitations:- GitHub Actions only right now. Planning to add GitLab and others later based on interest.- No build log viewing (by design) but direct links to GitHub- No mobile app yetPricing:Free tier for small projects. Paid starts at $13/mo if you need more repos or longer retention.---Would appreciate any feedback, especially on:- Is the webhook-only approach a meaningful differentiator, or do most people not care about the OAuth access issue?- What's missing that would make this useful for your team?Happy to answer questions about the architecture or anything else.\n\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46539786\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

Follow tutorials that take you from your first interaction to production-ready automation workflows with full customization.In this article:What is the AI Catalog?Browsing and enabling agents and flowsCreating, sharing, and managing visibilityUnderstanding versioning🎯 Try GitLab Duo Agent Platform today!Introduction to the AI CatalogThe AI Catalog is a central repository for discovering, creating, and sharing agents and flows across your organization. It promotes consistency, reusability, and collaboration by enabling teams to leverage pre-built solutions and best practices.What you can do:Discover: Browse agents and flows created by GitLab and the community.Create: Create and maintain custom agents and flows in a single interface.Enable: Enable agents and flows at your top-level group level, then use them in your projects.Share: Publish your agents and flows for others to use (Public or Private).Duplicate: Copy and customize existing agents and flows.\n\nAI CatalogAccessing and working with the AI CatalogNavigate to Explore → AI Catalog.The catalog currently provides two types:Agents — Custom agents for on-demand, interactive, or context-specific tasks.Flows — Custom flows for repeatable, multi-step automations, orchestrating a team of agents.For detailed information, see the AI Catalog documentation.Discover agents and flowsThe AI Catalog makes it easy to find agents and flows that fit your needs:How to browse:Navigate to Explore → AI Catalog.Select either Agents or Flows tab.Browse the available agents or flows and inspect title, description and visibility status.Click on any agent or flow to view more details.Enabling agents and flows:Once you find an agent or flow you want to use:Click the agent or flow to view details.Click the Enable in group button to add the agent or flow to your top-level group.Enable it in your project to start using it.Creating, sharing, and managing visibilityCreate agents and flowsHere are step-by-step instructions for creating agents and flows.Create agents:Navigate to Explore → AI Catalog → Agents → New agent.Brainstorm and define a specific task or specialization for this agent, for example, a debugging and troubleshooting agent.Add a display name and description to allow others to identify the purpose and why they would want to use the agent, for example troubleshoot-debugger.Specify visibility and access. Select a private project and set visibility to private to start with experiments.Define the agent behavior, capabilities, and specialization in the system prompt. For details on crafting effective system prompts, see Part 3: Understanding agents.Optionally select and limit the tool access for agents. For example, a debugging agent needs read access to code, issues, and merge requests, but may not require write access to make changes.Create flows:Navigate to Explore → AI Catalog → Flows → New flow.Brainstorm and define a complex multi-step specific task, for example, a CI/CD pipeline optimizer flow.Add a display name and description to allow others to identify the purpose and why they would want to use the flow, for example ci-cd-optimizer.Specify visibility and access. Select a private project and set visibility to private to start with experiments.Define the flow behavior and its agent components, prompts, and routers. For details on flow YAML structure, see Part 4: Understanding flows.For more details, see:Custom Agents documentationCustom Flows documentationShare your work and set visibilityWhen creating agents or flows, you can choose between Private and Public visibility to control who can access and use them.Private:Can be viewed only by members of the managing project who have at least the Developer role, or by users with the Owner role for the top-level group.Cannot be enabled in other projects.Useful for team-specific or sensitive workflows.Public:Viewable by anyone on the instance.Can be enabled in any project that meets prerequisites.Appears in AI Catalog for discovery.Best practices for sharingWhen publishing agents and flows to the AI Catalog, follow these guidelines:Naming:Use clear, descriptive names (e.g., security-code-review, api-documentation-generator).Avoid generic names like agent1 or my-flow.Include the purpose in the name when possible.Documentation:Provide a clear description of what the agent or flow does.Include use cases and examples.Document any prerequisites or dependencies.Quality:Test thoroughly before publishing.Ensure the agent or flow solves a real problem.Keep it maintainable and well-documented.Consider edge cases and error handling.Visibility decisions:Start with Private to test with your team.Move to Public once validated and documented.Only publish if it provides value to others.Consider the audience and use cases.Understanding versioningCustom agents and flows in the AI Catalog maintain a version history to track changes.How versioning works:GitLab automatically creates a new version when you update an agent's system prompt or modify a flow's configuration.Versions use semantic versioning (e.g., 1.0.0, 1.1.0).GitLab manages semantic versioning automatically — updates always increment the minor version.Versions are immutable, ensuring consistent behavior.Version pinning:When you enable an agent or flow:In a group: GitLab pins it to the latest version.In a project: GitLab pins it to the same version as your top-level group.This means:Your projects use a fixed, stable version of the agent or flow.Updates in the AI Catalog don't automatically affect your configuration.You must opt-in to update to new versions — updates are never automatic.You maintain full control over when to adopt new versions.Viewing versions:Navigate to Automate → Agents or Automate → Flows.Select the agent or flow to view its version on the right side in the About section.Updating to the latest versionWhen a new version of an agent or flow is available in the AI Catalog, you can update your projects to use it.Navigate to Automate → Agents or Automate → Flows.Click the agent or flow you want to update.Click the Update button (appears when a newer version is available).Review the changes in the new version.Confirm the update to pin your project to the latest version.What's next?You now understand how to discover, create, and share agents and flows through the AI Catalog.

GitLab offers flexible customization options across multiple levels:User-level: Personal preferences that apply across all projects (custom rules, AGENTS.md, MCP config)Workspace-level: Project-specific configurations (custom rules, AGENTS.md, MCP config)Project-level: Custom agents and flows you create and manage within a specific projectPart 1: Customize agent behaviorCustom rulesCustom rules provide instructions for agents and flows, ensuring consistent behavior across your team without requiring repetition. For example, in development style guides or how to execute tests.Navigate to IDE workspace or user configuration directory.User-level custom rulesUser-level rules apply to all your projects and workspaces.For detailed instructions on creating user-level custom rules, see the GitLab documentation.\nCreate the file ~/.gitlab/duo/chat-rules.md in your home directory.\nExample rules:- Include JSDoc comments for all functions\n- Use single quotes for strings\n- Follow the existing code style in the repository\n- Write concise explanations, avoid lengthy descriptions\n- Suggest tests for any code changes\n- Use async/await instead of promises\nWorkspace-level custom rulesWorkspace rules apply only to a specific project. They override user-level rules for that project.Create the file .gitlab/duo/chat-rules.md in your project root.Example rules for a Vue.js project:- Use Vue 3 Composition API with `<script setup>`\n- Always include TypeScript types for props\n- Use scoped styles with SCSS\n- Follow the Slippers UI design system\n- Keep components under 300 lines\n- Use kebab-case for component names\n- Include accessibility attributes (aria-*, role)\nBest practices for custom rulesBe specific: \"Use single quotes\" is better than \"follow style guide.\"Prioritize: List most important rules first.Team-focused: Rules should reflect your team's standards, not personal preferences.Actionable: Rules should be clear enough for an AI agent to follow.Maintainable: Update rules when your standards change.Avoid conflicts: Don't contradict your codebase's actual style.Tip: Use Code Owners to manage who approves changes to .gitlab/duo/chat-rules.md.For a detailed use case tutorial for custom rules, see the Custom rules in GitLab Duo Agentic Chat for greater developer efficiency deep-dive blog post.AGENTS.md for customizing agent behaviorAGENTS.md is an industry-standard file for customizing agent behavior. It allows you to define how agents should behave in your chat conversations, foundational flows, and custom flows without modifying the agents themselves.Difference to custom rules: AGENTS.md are consumed by all agents and flows (foundational and custom). It also follows an industry standard that other AI tools can use, for example, Claude Code as external agent. Use AGENTS.md when you want your instructions to apply across multiple contexts.User-level (applies to all your projects and workspaces):macOS/Linux: ~/.gitlab/duo/AGENTS.mdWindows: %APPDATA%\\GitLab\\duo\\AGENTS.mdWorkspace-level (applies to a specific project):Create AGENTS.md in your project root.Subdirectory-level (applies to specific directories in monorepos):Create AGENTS.md in subdirectories for context-specific instructions.How it works:User-level AGENTS.md applies globally across all projects.Workspace-level AGENTS.md applies to a specific project.Subdirectory-level AGENTS.md files provide context for specific parts of your codebase.Agents and flows combines instructions from all applicable levels.Newly added or updated AGENTS.md instructions require triggering new flows, or starting a new chat with a (custom) agent.What AGENTS.md controlsAgent personality and toneProject-specific instructionsCoding standards and conventionsTool usage preferencesOutput formatting requirementsRepository structure and organizationExample AGENTS.md# Agent Customization for Our Project\n## General Guidelines\n- Always prioritize code quality over speed\n- Follow our project's architecture patterns\n- Reference existing code examples when suggesting changes\n- Ask for clarification if requirements are ambiguous\n## Code Style\n- Use TypeScript for all new code\n- Follow ESLint configuration in the project\n- Include unit tests for all new functions\n- Use descriptive variable names (no single letters except loops)\n## Documentation\n- Add JSDoc comments to all public functions\n- Update README.md if adding new features\n- Include examples in code comments\n## Security\n- Never suggest hardcoding secrets or API keys\n- Always validate user input\n- Use parameterized queries for database operations\n- Flag potential security issues immediately\nBest practices for AGENTS.mdBe specific: Include concrete examples from your project.Keep it concise: Focus on what's unique to your project.Version control: Commit to your repository and track changes.Team alignment: Discuss with your team before finalizing.Update regularly: Refine as your project evolves.Document repository structure: Help agents understand your codebase organization.RequirementsGitLab 18.8 or laterFor VS Code: GitLab Workflow extension 6.60 or laterFor JetBrains: GitLab plugin 3.26.0 or laterFor flows: Update flow configuration to access the user_rule contextLearn more about AGENTS.md.Custom review instructionsCustom review instructions provide specific guidelines for the Code Review foundational flow. The instructions ensure consistent code review standards, and can be tailored to specific file types in your project.Create the file .gitlab/duo/mr-review-instructions.yaml in your project root.Example review instructions:instructions:\n  - name: Ruby Style Guide\n    fileFilters:\n      - \"*.rb\"           # Ruby files in the root directory\n      - \"lib/**/*.rb\"    # Ruby files in lib and its subdirectories\n      - \"!spec/**/*.rb\"  # Exclude test files\n    instructions: |\n      1. Ensure all methods have proper documentation\n      2. Follow Ruby style guide conventions\n      3. Prefer symbols over strings for hash keys\n\n  - name: TypeScript Source Files\n    fileFilters:\n      - \"**/*.ts\"        # TypeScript files in any directory\n      - \"!**/*.test.ts\"  # Exclude test files\n    instructions: |\n      1. Ensure proper TypeScript types (avoid 'any')\n      2. Follow naming conventions\n      3. Document complex functions\n\nBest practices for custom review instructions:Be specific and actionable: Clear, numbered instructions work best.Use glob patterns: Target specific file types with fileFilters.Focus on important standards: Prioritize the most critical review points.Explain the \"why\": Help reviewers understand the reasoning.Test patterns: Ensure glob patterns match the intended files.Tip: Use Code Owners to protect changes to .gitlab/duo/mr-review-instructions.yaml.For detailed setup instructions and examples, see the Custom Review Instructions documentation.Part 2: Extend capabilities with MCPModel Context Protocol (MCP) enables agents to access external systems like Jira, Slack, AWS, and more.

Before diving into customization, it's helpful to understand what they are and how they work. Here are parts of the Getting started with GitLab Duo Agent Platform guide that can help.Part 3: Understanding agents — Learn about foundational, custom, and external agents, and when to use each type.Part 4: Understanding flows — Discover how flows orchestrate multiple agents to solve complex problems.Part 5: AI Catalog — Learn how to discover, create, and share agents and flows across your organization.\nOnce you understand the basics, this section provides an overview of customization options with links to detailed guides.System prompts for custom agentsSystem prompts define an agent's personality, expertise, and behavior. A well-crafted prompt makes agents more effective and aligned with your team's needs.What are system prompts? System prompts are instructions that tell an agent how to behave, what expertise it has, and how to respond to requests. They're the foundation of custom agent behavior.Key elements of a strong system prompt:Role definition: What the agent is and what it doesExpertise areas: Specific domains or technologiesBehavior guidelines: How it should interact and respondOutput format: Structure of responsesConstraints: What it should avoidBest practices:Be detailed: More specific prompts produce better results.Use examples: Show the agent what good output looks like.Define scope: Clearly state what the agent should and shouldn't do.Test iteratively: Refine prompts based on agent behavior.Version control: Track prompt changes in your repository.For detailed guidance on crafting system prompts and creating custom agents, see Part 3: Understanding agents.Custom agents and flowsThere is a lot to learn, and for easier reading, the tutorials are split:Custom agents:Learn how to create agents with custom system prompts, configure tools, and manage permissions.See Part 3: Understanding agents - Custom agents section.Custom flows:Learn how to create multi-step workflows, configure components, and set up event-driven automation.See Part 4: Understanding flows — Custom flows section.Agent tools:Tools determine what actions agents can perform.

Unlike foundational and custom agents that work interactively in chat, external agents execute asynchronously, enabling powerful automation with specialized AI providers.Credential management: Starting with GitLab Duo Agent Platform general availability, GitLab-managed credentials will be used to support external agents, preventing the need for customers to manage and rotate API keys themselves.When to use external agentsYou need specific agentic AI behavior or LLMs for specialized tasks.You want event-triggered automation (not interactive chat).You need to meet specific compliance or data residency requirements.Why use external agents?Leverage specialized AI models: Access provider-specific capabilities like Claude Code's code analysis or OpenAI Codex's task delegation.Meet compliance requirements: Keep data within approved AI providers for regulatory or security policies.Experiment with providers: Test different agentic AI and LLM behavior to find the best fit for your workflows.Access unique features:  Use provider-specific tools like Claude Code's code analysis or OpenAI Codex's task delegation.Real-world exampleA development team uses OpenAI Codex as an external agent for code review. When developers create merge requests, they assign Codex as a reviewer. The agent:Analyzes the code changes in the MR.Checks for best practices and code quality issues.Suggests improvements and optimizations.Posts detailed review comments with specific recommendations.Links to relevant documentation.All of this happens automatically in the background while the developer continues working, with results posted directly in the merge request.Supported external agentsThe following integrations have been tested and are available:Anthropic Claude — Code generation, review, and analysisOpenAI Codex — GPT-powered code assistanceExample usage:@ai-codex Please implement this issueThis triggers a runner execution job that runs the external AI tool and posts results back to GitLab.Setting up external agentsFor complete setup instructions including service accounts, triggers, and configuration examples, see the External Agents documentation.Customizing agent behavior with AGENTS.mdCustomize how agents using AGENTS.md files following the agents.md standard.

    "summary": "Welcome to Part 4 of our eight-part guide, Getting started with GitLab Duo Agent Platform, where you'll master building and deploying AI agents and workflows within your development lifecycle. Follow tutorials that take you from your first interaction to production-ready automation workflows with full customization.In this article:What are flows and how do they work?Foundational flows provided by GitLabCreating custom flowsFlow execution and orchestrationReal-world examples and use cases🎯 Try GitLab Duo Agent Platform today!Introduction to flowsFlows are combinations of one or more agents collaborating together. They orchestrate multi-step workflows to solve complex problems, and are executed on the GitLab platform compute.Key characteristics of flows:Multi-agent orchestration: Combine multiple specialized agentsBuilt-in: Run on platform compute, no extra environment necessaryEvent-driven: Triggered by mention, assignment, or assign as reviewerAsynchronous: Run in background while you continue workingComplete workflows: Handle end-to-end tasks from analysis to implementationThink of flows as autonomous workflows that can gather context, make decisions, execute changes, and deliver results, all while you focus on other work.Flows vs. agents: Understanding the differenceAgents work with you interactively.

They run in GitLab Runner and can be triggered by GitLab events.🎯 Try it now: Interactive demo of Custom Flows — Explore how to create and configure Custom Flows.Why create custom flows?Custom flows automate repetitive multi-step tasks that are specific to your team's workflow. Unlike foundational flows that serve general purposes, custom flows are tailored to your organization's processes, tools, and requirements.Common use cases:Automated code review: Multi-stage review process (security scan → quality check → style validation)Compliance checking: Verify regulatory requirements, license compliance, or security policies on each MRDocumentation generation: Auto-update API docs, README files, or changelogs based on code changesDependency management: Weekly security scans, automated updates, and vulnerability reportsCustom testing: Specialized test suites for your tech stack or integration testsReal-world exampleA fintech company creates a compliance flow that runs on every merge request. When triggered by @compliance-flow, the flow executes the following steps:Security agent scans code for PCI-DSS violations and checks for exposed sensitive data.Code review agent verifies that changes follow secure coding standards and best practices.Documentation agent checks that API changes include updated documentation.Summary agent aggregates findings and posts a compliance report with pass/fail status.The entire compliance review happens automatically in 5-10 minutes, providing consistent checks across all merge requests.How to trigger custom flowsCustom flows can be triggered in multiple ways:1. Via mentions in Issues/MRs:\nMention the flow in a comment to trigger it. Example for a documentation generation flow:@doc-generator Generate API documentation for this feature\n2. By assigning the flow to an issue or MR:\nAssign the flow using either:GitLab UI: Click the \"Assign\" button on the issue/MR and select the flowCommand: Use the /assign command in a comment. Example:/assign @doc-generator\n3. By assigning the flow as a reviewer:\nAssign the flow as a reviewer on a merge request using either:GitLab UI: Click the \"Assign reviewer\" button on the merge request and select the flowCommand: Use the /assign_reviewer command in a comment. Example:/assign_reviewer @doc-reviewer\nAny of these methods automatically triggers the flow to execute and perform its tasks.How to create custom flowsCustom flows are created through the GitLab UI at Automate → Flows → New flow in your project, or from Explore → AI Catalog → Flows → New flow. You define your flow using YAML configuration that specifies components, prompts, routing, and execution flow. The YAML schema allows you to create sophisticated multi-agent workflows with precise control over agent behavior and orchestration.Key elements of a custom flow:Components: Define the agents and steps in your workflowPrompts: Configure AI model behavior and instructionsRouters: Control the flow between componentsToolsets: Specify which GitLab API tools agents can useExample custom flow YAMLBackground: This example shows a feature implementation flow for a travel booking platform. When a developer creates an issue with feature requirements, they can trigger this flow to automatically analyze the requirements, review the codebase, implement the solution, and create a merge request, all without manual intervention.\nHere's the YAML configuration:version: \"v1\"\nenvironment: ambient\ncomponents:\n  - name: \"implement_feature\"\n    type: AgentComponent\n    prompt_id: \"implementation_prompt\"\n    inputs:\n      - from: \"context:goal\"\n        as: \"user_goal\"\n      - from: \"context:project_id\"\n        as: \"project_id\"\n    toolset:\n      - \"get_issue\"\n      - \"get_repository_file\"\n      - \"list_repository_tree\"\n      - \"find_files\"\n      - \"blob_search\"\n      - \"create_file\"\n      - \"create_commit\"\n      - \"create_merge_request\"\n      - \"create_issue_note\"\n    ui_log_events:\n      - \"on_agent_final_answer\"\n      - \"on_tool_execution_success\"\n      - \"on_tool_execution_failed\"\n\nprompts:\n  - name: \"Cheapflights Feature Implementation\"\n    prompt_id: \"implementation_prompt\"\n    unit_primitives: []\n    prompt_template:\n      system: |\n        You are an expert full-stack developer specializing in travel booking platforms, specifically Cheapflights.\n\n        Your task is to:\n        1.

When triggered by an event (mention, assignment, or button click), a session is created and the flow starts to execute.Available environment variablesFlows have access to environment variables that provide context about the trigger and the GitLab object:AI_FLOW_CONTEXT — JSON-serialized context including MR diffs, issue descriptions, comments, and discussion threadsAI_FLOW_INPUT — The user's prompt or comment text that triggered the flowAI_FLOW_EVENT — The event type that triggered the flow (mention, assign, assign_reviewer)These variables allow your flow to understand what triggered it and access the relevant GitLab data to perform its task.Multi-agent flowsCustom flows can include multiple agent components that work together sequentially. The flow's YAML configuration defines:Components: One or more agents (AgentComponent) or deterministic stepsRouters: Define the flow between components (e.g., from component A to component B to end)Prompts: Configure each agent's behavior and modelFor example, a code review flow might have a security agent, then a quality agent, then an approval agent, with routers connecting them in sequence.Monitoring flow executionTo view flows that are running for your project:Navigate to Automate → Sessions.Select any session to view more details.The Details tab shows a link to the CI/CD job logs.Sessions show detailed information including step-by-step progress, tool invocations, reasoning, and decision-making process.When to use flowsComplex multi-step tasksBackground automationEvent-driven workflowsMulti-file changesTasks that take timeAutomated reviews/checksWhat's next?You now understand flows, how to create them, and when to use them vs. agents.

    "url": "https://about.gitlab.com/blog/strengthening-gitlab-com-security-mandatory-multi-factor-authentication/",
    "summary": "To strengthen the security of all user accounts on GitLab.com, GitLab is implementing mandatory multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users and API endpoints who sign in using a username and password.Why this is happeningThis move is a vital part of our Secure by Design commitment. MFA provides critical defense against credential stuffing and account takeover attacks, which remain persistent threats across the software development industry.Key information to knowWhat is changing?GitLab is making MFA mandatory for sign-ins that authenticate with a username and password. This introduces a critical second layer of security beyond just a password.Does this apply to me?Yes, it applies if: You sign in to GitLab.com with a username and a password, or use a password to authenticate to the API.No, it does not apply if: You exclusively use social sign-on (such as Google) or single sign-on (SSO) for access. (Please note: If you use SSO, but also have a password for direct login, you will still need MFA for any non-SSO, password-based login.)When is the rollout?The implementation will be a phased approach over the coming months, intended to both minimize unexpected interruptions and productivity loss for users and prevent account lockouts. Groups of users will be asked to enable MFA over time. Each group will be selected based on the actions they’ve taken or the code they’ve contributed to. You will be notified in the following ways:\n✉️ Email notification - prior to the phase where you will be impacted🔔 Regular in-product reminders - 14 days before⏱️ After a specific time period (this will be shared via email) - blocked from accessing GitLab until you enable MFAWhat action do I need to take?If you sign in to GitLab.com with a username and a password:\nWe highly recommend you proactively set up one of the available MFA methods today, such as passkeys, an authenticator app, a WebAuthn device, or email verification. This ensures the most secure and seamless transition:Go to your GitLab.com User Settings.Select the Account section.Activate two-factor authentication and configure your preferred method (e.g., authenticator app or a WebAuthn device).Securely save your recovery codes to guarantee you can regain access if needed.If you use a password to authenticate to the API:\nWe  highly recommend you proactively switch to a personal access token (PAT). Read our documentation to learn more.FAQWhat happens if I don't enable MFA by the deadline?You'll be required to set up MFA before you can sign in.Does this affect CI/CD pipelines or automation?Yes, unless you're using PATs or deploy tokens instead of passwords.I use SSO but sometimes sign in directly, do I need MFA?Yes, MFA is required for any password-based authentication, including fallback scenarios.Specific timelines and further resources will be shared as rollout dates approach.
