    "url": "https://www.deployfreeze.com/",
    "summary": "Hi HN; I built DeployFreeze after getting tired of engineers frantically pinging “@here, don’t deploy product-service” during incidents and investigations.DeployFreeze is a GitHub App that creates deployment freezes using GitHub’s custom deployment protection rules (https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/deploy/configure-...). It pauses deployments to specific environments without blocking merges or CI, and gives teams a single place to see what’s frozen and why.This is particularly useful in monorepos, where you might want to freeze `production-api` while keeping `production-web` or staging deployable. The app only uses deployment webhooks and doesn’t require access to source code.If you don’t use GitHub Actions but still see “Deployments” in your repo sidebar, this may work for you. Many platforms use GitHub’s deployment API behind the scenes, so you may already be set up even if you didn’t explicitly configure it.I’d love feedback on how your teams handle deployment freezes today or any thoughts on this approach. There’s a 30-day free trial if you want to try it for upcoming end-of-year freezes.\n\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46313715\nPoints: 5\n# Comments: 0",

    "summary": "Hi HN,We are the team behind Shuttle (YC S20). We just shipped Neptune, (https://github.com/shuttle-hq/neptune-mcp) an open source MCP server that lets coding agents actually deploy software, not just write code. Behind it is an app deployment platform we built to be friendly for AI agents.Neptune runs in your IDE. It reads your codebase, analyzes its structure and intent using ASTs and inference, and generates a deterministic infrastructure spec called neptune.json. You can inspect every change, approve it, and apply it. Think: coding agents that can actually ship safely to AWS.How it works in practice:1. Take any of your existing apps\n2. Install Neptune mcp & login\n3. Tell your agent to deploy\n4. Watch it do everything else for you and (super important) it keeps you in the loop at every step, asking for your approval and guidance. We’ve spent most of our time implementing guardrails to make this as safe as if you were doing it yourself.We built this after seeing teams rely on AI to write services, but still hand-craft Terraform and YAML. The AI could write code, but it could not understand the system around it. Neptune tries to close that gap.Right now we have support for the most basic AWS products (ECS, S3, SecretManager), and we support postgres (thanks to Neon) and we are adding more resources as we speak. For now, your apps are all deployed to our a shared tenancy AWS account, and “bring your own cloud” account is coming soon too.If you are also excited about a future where coding agents can help you reliably ship stuff into production, try it and share what you think.If you have tried it on shared tenancy and would like to run it in your own AWS account, just get in touch and we’d be happy to help.\n\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46276419\nPoints: 18\n# Comments: 8",

You can inspect every change, approve it, and apply it. Think: coding agents that can actually ship safely to AWS.How it works in practice:1. Take any of your existing apps\n2. Install Neptune mcp & login\n3. Tell your agent to deploy\n4. Watch it do everything else for you and (super important) it keeps you in the loop at every step, asking for your approval and guidance. We’ve spent most of our time implementing guardrails to make this as safe as if you were doing it yourself.We built this after seeing teams rely on AI to write services, but still hand-craft Terraform and YAML. The AI could write code, but it could not understand the system around it. Neptune tries to close that gap.Right now we have support for the most basic AWS products (ECS, S3, SecretManager), and we support postgres (thanks to Neon) and we are adding more resources as we speak. For now, your apps are all deployed to our a shared tenancy AWS account, and “bring your own cloud” account is coming soon too.If you are also excited about a future where coding agents can help you reliably ship stuff into production, try it and share what you think.If you have tried it on shared tenancy and would like to run it in your own AWS account, just get in touch and we’d be happy to help.\n\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46276419\nPoints: 18\n# Comments: 8",

    "summary": "GitLab 18.7 delivers development, operations, and security capabilities that strengthen control, improve consistency, and build confidence as teams integrate AI further into their workflows. These improvements arrive as GitLab approaches a major milestone. GitLab Duo Agent Platform will reach general availability in January 2026 with our 18.8 release, pending we continue to meet the exceptionally high quality standards we set for ourselves in service to our customers worldwide across all industries.GitLab Duo Agent Platform's GA is designed to introduce a unified, governed way for organizations to orchestrate agentic AI across their software lifecycle. With foundational agents, custom agents, and automated flows working together inside GitLab, teams will be able to adopt agentic workflows that help accelerate work while staying aligned to organizational standards. At GA, we also plan to include expanded AI Catalog functionality, stronger administrative controls, reliability enhancements, and a flexible usage-based billing model designed to provide flexibility for agentic AI usage across many roles and projects.The 18.7 release adds important building blocks to support GitLab Duo Agent Platform’s upcoming GA. New automation features, stronger governance controls, and enhancements across security and pipeline authoring help teams streamline their work and lay the groundwork for an even more reliable agentic experience in 18.8 and beyond.On February 10, 2026, we will host a global event that brings our vision of GitLab as the intelligent orchestration platform to life, where software teams and their AI agents stay in flow. You will hear how customers are tackling the AI paradox in software delivery, see intelligent orchestration in action across DevSecOps workflows, and get a jump start on what this next chapter means for your own modernization journey. Reserve your spot to see how GitLab’s next chapter comes together.Here's what is new in 18.7:GitLab Duo Agent PlatformAs more teams bring AI into their development and security workflows, GitLab continues to focus on making adoption powerful and predictable. The updates in 18.7 strengthen the foundation for guided, governed AI experiences that will become fully realized when GitLab Duo Agent Platform reaches GA, as planned for 18.8.Custom FlowsCustom Flows introduce a new way for teams to automate multistep workflows using YAML-defined sequences that orchestrate agents to complete repetitive development tasks. Custom Flows help eliminate manual effort for scenarios that follow predictable patterns — such as diagnosing and fixing failed pipelines, updating dependencies, or running policy checks when reviewers are assigned. Instead of handling these tasks interactively, teams can define flows that automatically trigger from GitLab events like mentions and assignments. This capability supports developers who want tailored automations for their own projects, as well as administrators who need consistent, organization-wide workflows for compliance and operational efficiency.SAST False Positive Detection FlowAI-powered false positive management for Static Application Security Testing (SAST) works to introduce a faster, more accurate way for teams to assess and act on potential false positives. GitLab now uses AI to help identify which findings may be false positives earlier in the review process, reducing the time developers and security teams spend triaging noise. Users can see an overview of how many vulnerabilities may warrant review, track their analysis progress, and dismiss false positives directly from the vulnerability report. Once dismissed, these findings stay dismissed across future pipelines and continue to reflect the correct dismissed status in merge request widgets. This assists with a consistent and reliable signal as code evolves and helps teams focus on real risks, streamline remediation, and cut down on unnecessary security review cycles.Custom Agent VersioningCustom Agent Versioning gives teams control over which version of an AI Catalog agent or flow they use in their projects. Instead of automatically inheriting updates from the creator, GitLab now pins each project to the exact version of the agent and flow enabled for the team. This helps prevent breaking changes, security risks, and workflow disruptions, especially in production pipelines or security-sensitive environments. Teams can upgrade when they choose, test new versions in staging before promoting them, and clearly see which version is running to avoid confusion. It also enables safer customization by letting users fork an agent at a specific version and evolve it independently. The result is a more predictable, stable, and secure way to adopt custom agents across development and CI/CD workflows.New Settings for Foundational AgentsAdmins now have the ability to turn foundational agents on or off, giving teams greater control over how AI is used across their organization. With this update, admins can enable or disable these agents at the instance or group level, choose default availability, and control how new agents are introduced while still providing access to the core agent. The result is more flexible AI adoption with the governance, consistency, and control enterprise teams need.Data Analyst AgentThe Data Analyst Agent gives teams a simple way to explore GitLab data using natural language, automatically generating GitLab Query Language (GLQL)  queries, retrieving relevant information, and presenting clear insights without requiring dashboards or manual query writing. Users can analyze work volume, understand team activity, identify development trends, monitor issue and merge request status, and quickly discover work items by labels, authors, milestones, or other criteria. It also creates reusable GLQL queries that can be embedded anywhere GitLab Flavored Markdown is supported, making it easier to share findings and answer everyday questions about project activity directly within GitLab.Core DevOpsInnovations with GitLab Duo Agent Platform are most effective when the underlying DevOps experience is equally streamlined and dependable. The improvements in 18.7 to core GitLab workflows help ensure that automation, pipelines, and reusable components operate with highest levels of clarity and consistency.Dynamic Input Selection in GitLab PipelinesDynamic Input Selection in GitLab Pipelines introduces a more intuitive way to trigger pipelines through dynamic, cascading dropdown fields in the GitLab UI. This allows cross-functional teams to run pipelines without editing YAML or relying on developers, while ensuring that only valid, context-aware options are shown as they make selections. The feature supports complex workflows, assists with reducing misconfigured runs, and removes a key blocker for teams migrating from Jenkins Active Choice, helping organizations standardize their CI/CD processes entirely on GitLab.CI/CD Catalog Publication GuardrailsAdministrators of GitLab Self-Managed and GitLab Dedicated can now control which projects are allowed to publish components to the CI/CD Catalog. This new setting helps organizations maintain a curated, trusted ecosystem by ensuring only approved sources can add components. It strengthens governance for enterprise customers who want to preserve control over their CI/CD landscape while still enabling teams to discover and reuse sanctioned components.Platform SecurityAs automation and pipeline workflows become more efficient, it remains essential that teams maintain strong visibility and control over how code changes meet organizational standards. The Platform Security update in 18.7 reinforces this balance by giving teams a more flexible way to introduce and refine policy guidance without interrupting delivery.Warn Mode for MR Approval PoliciesWarn Mode for MR Approval Policies allows violations to be surfaced without blocking merges, giving teams a lower-friction way to introduce or adjust policies while assessing their impact before full enforcement. It also supports a guidance-based approach, where developers can review or dismiss violations with all actions audited to help AppSec refine policy effectiveness. Beyond merge requests, violations already present or introduced into the default branch now appear with a visual badge in the Vulnerability Report, making it easier to identify and prioritize issues that break policy.Elevating how teams build, secure, and deliver softwareThe 18.7 release is about strengthening the foundation for reliable, flexible automation across your GitLab environment.GitLab Premium and Ultimate users can start using these capabilities today on GitLab.com and self-managed environments, with availability for GitLab Dedicated customers planned for next month.GitLab Duo Agent Platform is currently in beta — enable beta and experimental features to experience how full-context AI can transform the way your teams build software.
