    "url": "https://orkera.com/",
    "summary": "Hey HN, we’re Maya and Riles, and we’ve been working on Orkera (orkera.com); an MCP tool that lets you create and manage backend infrastructure through prompts. It handles database creation/management, deployments, cron jobs, and environment setup, all via MCP calls from your coding agent.Demo video: https://youtu.be/runSblXCYD0Why we built it:\nWe’re part of the startup community in Paris and kept seeing the same bottleneck: people can build a frontend or MVP quickly (especially with Cursor/Claude/Gemini), but the moment they want to share it with users, they hit DevOps friction: setting up a VM, creating a database, configuring deployment, choosing a domain, etc.We wanted to make that step disappear.\nSo we built Orkera: an MCP-based backend layer that tools like Cursor, Claude Code, and Gemini CLI can call to create infra and deploy apps automatically.What it does today:\n- create and manage databases,\n- deploy web apps without cloud setup,\n- handle cron-like scheduled jobs,\n- manage environments through MCP\nAll from inside your vibecoding tool.What we’re looking for:\nThis is the first public version (after some early feedback cycles) and we’d love testers who can tell us what’s missing, what feels weird, and what should be more transparent or configurable.Setup:\nGetting Orkera running is simple; register to get an API key, then add the MCP endpoint to your editor. We published small setup guides for Cursor, Claude Code, and Gemini CLI on orkera.com.Thanks for taking a look, and we’d appreciate feedback, criticism, and suggestions.\n\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46067943\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 2",

    "summary": "Migrating from Azure DevOps to GitLab can seem like a daunting task, but with the right approach and tools, it can be a smooth and efficient process. This guide will walk you through the steps needed to successfully migrate your projects, repositories, and pipelines from Azure DevOps to GitLab.\nOverview\nGitLab provides both Congregate (maintained by GitLab Professional Services organization) and a built-in Git repository import for migrating projects from Azure DevOps (ADO). These options support repository-by-repository or bulk migration and preserve git commit history, branches, and tags. With Congregate and professional services tools, we support additional assets such as wikis, work items, CI/CD variables, container images, packages, pipelines, and more (see this feature matrix). Use this guide to plan and execute your migration and complete post-migration follow-up tasks.\nEnterprises migrating from ADO to GitLab commonly follow a multi-phase approach:\n\n\nMigrate repositories from ADO to GitLab using Congregate or GitLab's built-in repository migration.\n\n\nMigrate pipelines from Azure Pipelines to GitLab CI/CD.\n\n\nMigrate remaining assets such as boards, work items, and artifacts to GitLab Issues, Epics, and the Package and Container Registries.\n\n\nHigh-level migration phases:\ngraph LR\n    subgraph Prerequisites\n        direction TB\n        A[\"Set up identity provider (IdP) and<br/>provision users\"]\n        A --> B[\"Set up runners and<br/>third-party integrations\"]\n        B --> I[\"Users enablement and<br/>change management\"]\n    end\n    \n    subgraph MigrationPhase[\"Migration phase\"]\n        direction TB\n        C[\"Migrate source code\"]\n        C --> D[\"Preserve contributions and<br/> format history\"]\n        D --> E[\"Migrate work items and<br/>map to <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/topics/plan_and_track/\">GitLab Plan <br/>and track work\"]\n    end\n    \n    subgraph PostMigration[\"Post-migration steps\"]\n        direction TB\n        F[\"Create or translate <br/>ADO pipelines to GitLab CI\"]\n        F --> G[\"Migrate other assets<br/>packages and container images\"]\n        G --> H[\"Introduce <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/secure_your_application/\">security</a> and<br/>SDLC improvements\"]\n    end\n    \n    Prerequisites --> MigrationPhase\n    MigrationPhase --> PostMigration\n\n    style A fill:#FC6D26\n    style B fill:#FC6D26\n    style I fill:#FC6D26\n    style C fill:#8C929D\n    style D fill:#8C929D\n    style E fill:#8C929D\n    style F fill:#FFA500\n    style G fill:#FFA500\n    style H fill:#FFA500\n\nPlanning your migration\nTo plan your migration, ask these questions:\n\n\nHow soon do we need to complete the migration?\n\n\nDo we understand what will be migrated?\n\n\nWho will run the migration?\n\n\nWhat organizational structure do we want in GitLab?\n\n\nAre there any constraints, limitations, or pitfalls that need to be taken into account?\n\n\nDetermine your timeline, as it will largely dictate your migration approach. Identify champions or groups familiar with both ADO and GitLab platforms (such as early adopters) to help drive adoption and provide guidance.\nInventory what you need to migrate:\n\n\nThe number of repositories, pull requests, and contributors\n\n\nThe number and complexity of work items and pipelines\n\n\nRepository sizes and dependency relationships\n\n\nCritical integrations and runner requirements (agent pools with specific capabilities)\n\n\nUse GitLab Professional Services's Evaluate tool to produce a complete inventory of your entire Azure DevOps organization, including repositories, PR counts, contributor lists, number of pipelines, work items, CI/CD variables and more. If you're working with the GitLab Professional Services team, share this report with your engagement manager or technical architect to help plan the migration.\nMigration timing is primarily driven by pull request count, repository size, and amount of contributions (e.g. comments in PR, work items, etc). For example, 1,000 small repositories with few PRs and limited contributors can migrate much faster than a smaller set of repositories containing tens of thousands of PRs and thousands of contributors. Use your inventory data to estimate effort and plan test runs before proceeding with production migrations.\nCompare inventory against your desired timeline and decide whether to migrate all repositories at once or in batches. If teams cannot migrate simultaneously, batch and stagger migrations to align with team schedules. For example, in Professional Services engagements, we organize migrations into waves of 200-300 projects to manage complexity and respect API rate limits, both in GitLab and ADO.\nGitLab's built-in repository importer migrates Git repositories (commits, branches, and tags) one-by-one. Congregate is designed to preserve pull requests (known in GitLab as merge requests), comments, and related metadata where possible; the simple built-in repository import focuses only on the Git data (history, branches, and tags).\nItems that typically require separate migration or manual recreation:\n\n\nAzure Pipelines - create equivalent GitLab CI/CD pipelines (consult with CI/CD YAML and/or with CI/CD components). Alternatively, consider using AI-based pipeline conversion available in Congregate.\n\n\nWork items and boards - map to GitLab Issues, Epics, and Issue Boards.\n\n\nArtifacts, container images (ACR) - migrate to GitLab Package Registry or Container Registry.\n\n\nService hooks and external integrations - recreate in GitLab.\n\n\nPermissions models differ between ADO and GitLab; review and plan permissions mapping rather than assuming exact preservation.\n\n\nReview what each tool (Congregate vs. built-in import) will migrate and choose the one that fits your needs. Make a list of any data or integrations that must be migrated or recreated manually.\nWho will run the migration?\nMigrations are typically run by a GitLab group owner or instance administrator, or by a designated migrator who has been granted the necessary permissions on the destination group/project. Congregate and the GitLab import APIs require valid authentication tokens for both Azure DevOps and GitLab.\n\n\nDecide whether a group owner/admin will perform the migrations or whether you will grant a specific team/person delegated access.\n\n\nEnsure the migrator has correctly configured personal access tokens (Azure DevOps and GitLab) with the scopes required by your chosen migration tool (for example, api/read_repository scopes and any tool-specific requirements).\n\n\nTest tokens and permissions with a small pilot migration.\n\n\nNote: Congregate leverages file-based import functionality for ADO migrations and requires instance administrator permissions to run (see our documentation). If you are migrating to GitLab.com, consider engaging Professional Services. For more information, see the Professional Services Full Catalog. Non-admin account cannot preserve contribution attribution!\nWhat organizational structure do we want in GitLab?\nWhile it's possible to map ADO structure directly to GitLab structure, it's recommended to rationalize and simplify the structure during migration. Consider how teams will work in GitLab and design the structure to facilitate collaboration and access management. Here is a way to think about mapping ADO structure to GitLab structure:\ngraph TD\n    subgraph GitLab\n        direction TB\n        A[\"Top-level Group\"]\n        B[\"Subgroup (optional)\"]\n        C[\"Projects\"]\n        A --> B\n        A --> C\n        B --> C\n    end\n\n    subgraph AzureDevOps[\"Azure DevOps\"]\n        direction TB\n        F[\"Organizations\"]\n        G[\"Projects\"]\n        H[\"Repositories\"]\n        F --> G\n        G --> H\n    end\n\n    style A fill:#FC6D26\n    style B fill:#FC6D26\n    style C fill:#FC6D26\n    style F fill:#8C929D\n    style G fill:#8C929D\n    style H fill:#8C929D\n\nRecommended approach:\n\n\nMap each ADO organization to a GitLab group (or a small set of groups), not to many small groups. Avoid creating a GitLab group for every ADO team project. Use migration as an opportunity to rationalize your GitLab structure.\n\n\nUse subgroups and project-level permissions to group related repositories.\n\n\nManage access to sets of projects by using GitLab groups and group membership (groups and subgroups) rather than one group per team project.\n\n\nReview GitLab permissions and consider SAML Group Links to implement an enterprise RBAC model for your GitLab instance (or a GitLab.com namespace).\n\n\nADO Boards and work items: State of migration\nIt's important to understand how work items migrate from ADO into GitLab Plan (issues, epics, and boards).\n\n\nADO Boards and work items map to GitLab Issues, Epics, and Issue Boards. Plan how your workflows and board configurations will translate.\n\n\nADO Epics and Features become GitLab Epics.\n\n\nOther work item types (e.g., user stories, tasks, bugs) become project-scoped issues.\n\n\nMost standard fields are preserved; selected custom fields can be migrated when supported.\n\n\nParent-child relationships are retained so Epics reference all related issues.\n\n\nLinks to pull requests are converted to merge request links to maintain development traceability.\n\n\nExample: Migration of an individual work item to a GitLab Issue, including field accuracy and relationships:\n\nBatching guidance:\n\n\nIf you need to run migrations in batches, use your new group/subgroup structure to define batches (for example, by ADO organization or by product area).\n\n\nUse inventory reports to drive batch selection and test each batch with a pilot migration before scaling.\n\n\nPipelines migration\nCongregate recently introduced AI-powered conversion for multi-stage YAML pipelines from Azure DevOps to GitLab CI/CD. This automated conversion works best for simple, single-file pipelines and is designed to provide a working starting point rather than a production-ready .gitlab-ci.yml file. The tool generates a functionally equivalent GitLab pipeline that you can then refine and optimize for your specific needs.\n\n\nConverts Azure Pipelines YAML to .gitlab-ci.yml format automatically.\n\n\nBest suited for straightforward, single-file pipeline configurations.\n\n\nProvides a boilerplate to accelerate migration, not a final production artifact.\n\n\nRequires review and adjustment for complex scenarios, custom tasks, or enterprise requirements.\n\n\nDoes not support Azure DevOps classic release pipelines — convert these to multi-stage YAML first.\n\n\nRepository owners should review the GitLab CI/CD documentation to further optimize and enhance their pipelines after the initial conversion.\nExample of converted pipelines:\n\n# azure-pipelines.yml\n\ntrigger:\n  - main\n\nvariables:\n  imageName: myapp\n\nstages:\n  - stage: Build\n    jobs:\n      - job: Build\n        pool:\n          vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'\n        steps:\n          - checkout: self\n\n          - task: Docker@2\n            displayName: Build Docker image\n            inputs:\n              command: build\n              repository: $(imageName)\n              Dockerfile: '**/Dockerfile'\n              tags: |\n                $(Build.BuildId)\n\n  - stage: Test\n    jobs:\n      - job: Test\n        pool:\n          vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'\n        steps:\n          - checkout: self\n\n          # Example: run tests inside the container\n          - script: |\n              docker run --rm $(imageName):$(Build.BuildId) npm test\n            displayName: Run tests\n\n  - stage: Push\n    jobs:\n      - job: Push\n        pool:\n          vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'\n        steps:\n          - checkout: self\n\n          - task: Docker@2\n            displayName: Login to ACR\n            inputs:\n              command: login\n              containerRegistry: '<your-acr-service-connection>'\n\n          - task: Docker@2\n            displayName: Push image to ACR\n            inputs:\n              command: push\n              repository: $(imageName)\n              tags: |\n                $(Build.BuildId)\n\n\n\n# .gitlab-ci.yml\n\nvariables:\n  imageName: myapp\n\nstages:\n  - build\n  - test\n  - push\n\nbuild:\n  stage: build\n  image: docker:latest\n  services:\n    - docker:dind\n  script:\n    - docker build -t $imageName:$CI_PIPELINE_ID -f $(find . -name Dockerfile) .\n  only:\n    - main\n\ntest:\n  stage: test\n  image: docker:latest\n  services:\n    - docker:dind\n  script:\n    - docker run --rm $imageName:$CI_PIPELINE_ID npm test\n  only:\n    - main\n\npush:\n  stage: push\n  image: docker:latest\n  services:\n    - docker:dind\n  before_script:\n    - docker login -u $CI_REGISTRY_USER -p $CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD $CI_REGISTRY\n  script:\n    - docker tag $imageName:$CI_PIPELINE_ID $CI_REGISTRY/$CI_PROJECT_PATH/$imageName:$CI_PIPELINE_ID\n    - docker push $CI_REGISTRY/$CI_PROJECT_PATH/$imageName:$CI_PIPELINE_ID\n  only:\n    - main\n\n\nFinal checklist:\n\n\nDecide timeline and batch strategy.\n\n\nProduce a full inventory of repositories, PRs, and contributors.\n\n\nChoose Congregate or the built-in import based on scope (PRs and metadata vs. Git data only).\n\n\nDecide who will run migrations and ensure tokens/permissions are configured.\n\n\nIdentify assets that must be migrated separately (pipelines, work items, artifacts, and hooks) and plan those efforts.\n\n\nRun pilot migrations, validate results, then scale according to your plan.\n\n\nRunning your migrations\nAfter planning, execute migrations in stages, starting with trial runs. Trial migrations help surface org-specific issues early and let you measure duration, validate outcomes, and fine-tune your approach before production.\nWhat trial migrations validate:\n\n\nWhether a given repository and related assets migrate successfully (history, branches, tags; plus MRs/comments if using Congregate)\n\n\nWhether the destination is usable immediately (permissions, runners, CI/CD variables, integrations)\n\n\nHow long each batch takes, to set schedules and stakeholder expectations\n\n\nDowntime guidance:\n\n\nGitLab's built-in Git import and Congregate do not inherently require downtime.\n\n\nFor production waves, freeze changes in ADO (branch protections or read-only) to avoid missed commits, PR updates, or work items created mid-migration.\n\n\nTrial runs do not require freezes and can be run anytime.\n\n\nBatching guidance:\n\n\nRun trial batches back-to-back to shorten elapsed time; let teams validate results asynchronously.\n\n\nUse your planned group/subgroup structure to define batches and respect API rate limits.\n\n\nRecommended steps:\n\nCreate a test destination in GitLab for trials:\n\n\n\nGitLab.com: create a dedicated group/namespace (for example, my-org-sandbox)\n\n\nSelf-managed: create a top-level group or a separate test instance if needed\n\n\n\nPrepare authentication:\n\n\n\nAzure DevOps PAT with required scopes.\n\n\nGitLab Personal Access Token with api and read_repository (plus admin access for file-based imports used by Congregate).\n\n\n\nRun trial migrations:\n\n\n\nRepos only: use GitLab's built-in import (Repo by URL)\n\n\nRepos + PRs/MRs and additional assets: use Congregate\n\n\n\nPost-trial follow-up:\n\n\n\nVerify repo history, branches, tags; merge requests (if migrated), issues/epics (if migrated), labels, and relationships.\n\n\nCheck permissions/roles, protected branches, required approvals, runners/tags, variables/secrets, integrations/webhooks.\n\n\nValidate pipelines (.gitlab-ci.yml) or converted pipelines where applicable.\n\n\n\n\nAsk users to validate functionality and data fidelity.\n\n\nResolve issues uncovered during trials and update your runbooks.\n\n\nNetwork and security:\n\n\n\nIf your destination uses IP allow lists, add the IPs of your migration host and any required runners/integrations so imports can succeed.\n\n\nRun production migrations in waves:\n\n\n\nEnforce change freezes in ADO during each wave.\n\n\nMonitor progress and logs; retry or adjust batch sizes if you hit rate limits.\n\n\n\nOptional: remove the sandbox group or archive it after you finish.\n\n<figure class=\"video_container\">\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ibIXGfrVbi4?si=ZxOVnXjCF-h4Ne0N\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe>\n</figure>\nTerminology reference for GitLab and Azure DevOps\n\n\n\nGitLab\nAzure DevOps\nSimilarities & Key Differences\n\n\n\n\nGroup\nOrganization\nTop-level namespace, membership, policies.

    "url": "https://about.gitlab.com/blog/automate-embedded-systems-compliance-with-gitlab-and-codesonar/",
    "summary": "Embedded systems development teams face a persistent challenge: maintaining development velocity while meeting stringent functional safety and code quality requirements. Standards like ISO 26262, IEC 62304, DO-178C, and IEC 61508 demand rigorous verification processes that are often manual and time-consuming. Compliance reviews against coding standards like MISRA C/C++, isolated scanning workflows, and post-development verification create bottlenecks. Teams are forced to choose between speed and safety.\nGitLab's integration with CodeSonar (from AdaCore) addresses this challenge by automating compliance workflows and enabling continuous verification throughout the development lifecycle.\nSpecialized scanning for safety-critical systems\nSafety-critical systems require deep analysis of C/C++ code compiled with specialized embedded tools. These systems must demonstrate compliance with coding standards (MISRA C/C++, CERT C/C++, AUTOSAR C++) and functional safety frameworks (ISO 26262, DO-178C, IEC 61508) that require detailed evidence trails. Beyond aligning with coding standards, teams also need to address security concerns. This means testing for memory problems as well as a host of other problems like uninitialized variables and command injection.\nCodeSonar performs whole program analysis with specialized scanning capabilities for these standards. Pairing CodeSonar with GitLab enables teams to automate compliance workflows and maintain comprehensive audit trails throughout the development lifecycle.\nAutomating compliance from commit to merge\nThe GitLab and CodeSonar integration provides a compliance-as-code approach that automates policy enforcement from the earliest stages of development. CodeSonar functions as an additional scanner within GitLab CI/CD pipelines, analyzing code in every commit and merge request.\nBecause CodeSonar was purpose-built for embedded systems, it performs deep control flow and data flow analysis across entire programs, identifying vulnerabilities like buffer overruns, data taint, uninitialized variables, use-after-free conditions, and command injection — the root causes of most security incidents in embedded systems.\nThe integration works through GitLab's CI/CD configuration. When developers push code changes, the pipeline triggers CodeSonar scanning. For C and C++ firmware, CodeSonar observes compiler invocations during the actual build process, creating an internal representation of the code that enables sophisticated analysis. Results are converted from SARIF format to GitLab's Static Application Security Testing (SAST) format and surfaced directly in merge requests, where they feed into GitLab Ultimate's Security Dashboard, Vulnerability Management, and Compliance Frameworks.\nExample workflow: ISO 26262 ASIL-D compliance\nThe demo video below shows the complete workflow for an embedded system subject to ISO 26262 ASIL-D requirements. The scenario illustrates how embedded development teams can implement continuous compliance without compromising development velocity.\n<div style=\"padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/1139086924?badge=0&autopause=0&player_id=0&app_id=58479\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" title=\"Automated Compliance for Embedded Systems using GitLab and CodeSonar\"></iframe></div><script src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js\"></script>`\nThe workflow begins with a developer submitting a merge request for firmware changes. GitLab's CI/CD pipeline automatically triggers CodeSonar scanning, which performs deep C/C++ analysis against custom ISO 26262 policies configured in the pipeline. When CodeSonar identifies an ASIL-D relevant vulnerability, the pipeline halts automatically per the compliance policy, with clear documentation explaining the issue. The complete scan results, issue tracking, and approval workflow are maintained in GitLab as a single source of truth for audit trails.\nDevelopers can use both the CodeSonar hub interface and GitLab Duo AI to understand the vulnerability. CodeSonar provides detailed information about the path through the source code that leads to the problem, along with code navigation features to isolate the root cause. GitLab Duo explains the vulnerability and provides specific remediation recommendations. After the developer implements the fix and validates the resolution, the code merges successfully with full compliance evidence automatically collected throughout the process.\nBenefits of the integration\nOrganizations implementing this integrated compliance with GitLab and CodeSonar will see significant improvements in both development velocity and compliance confidence.\n\n\nEfficiency gains: Development teams reduce time-to-market by catching coding standard compliance issues early when they're less expensive to fix. Automated security policy enforcement decreases manual security review overhead, freeing specialists to focus on complex problems rather than routine checks. Audit readiness improves through automated evidence collection. Compliance artifacts are generated as a by-product of normal development rather than through separate documentation efforts.\n\n\nCompliance maturity: This integrated approach helps organizations maintain continuous compliance with industry standards and regulations. By embedding verification into every code change, teams build comprehensive audit trails that demonstrate adherence to ISO 26262, DO-178C, MISRA C/C++, and other requirements. The automated workflow transforms compliance from a periodic checkpoint into an ongoing verification process.\n\n\nImplementation considerations\nImplementing the GitLab and CodeSonar integration requires access to GitLab Ultimate, a CodeSonar hub, GitLab runners where code can be compiled and analyzed, and appropriate mechanisms for managing analysis data files. Both GitLab and CodeSonar fully support on-premises and air-gapped environments and can be deployed to auto-scalable cloud environments as well.\nTeams should configure Custom Compliance Frameworks in GitLab to define specific policies for their relevant standards: ISO 26262 for automotive, DO-178C for aerospace, IEC 62304 for medical devices, and others. These frameworks enable automated enforcement of compliance requirements through merge request approval rules, vulnerability thresholds, and scan policy gates.\nGet started\nThe CodeSonar GitLab CI component is available through GitLab's CI/CD Catalog. Detailed integration documentation provides platform-specific setup instructions for Linux, Docker, and Windows environments. For organizations evaluating this solution, the implementation demonstrates how specialized embedded systems tools can integrate with a modern DevSecOps platform to deliver both development velocity and compliance rigor.\nFor more information about implementing GitLab with CodeSonar for your embedded systems development, visit the CodeSonar integration documentation.
