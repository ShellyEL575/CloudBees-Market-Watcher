    "summary": "Hey HN, we’re Maya and Riles, and we’ve been working on Orkera (orkera.com); an MCP tool that lets you create and manage backend infrastructure through prompts. It handles database creation/management, deployments, cron jobs, and environment setup, all via MCP calls from your coding agent.Demo video: https://youtu.be/runSblXCYD0Why we built it:\nWe’re part of the startup community in Paris and kept seeing the same bottleneck: people can build a frontend or MVP quickly (especially with Cursor/Claude/Gemini), but the moment they want to share it with users, they hit DevOps friction: setting up a VM, creating a database, configuring deployment, choosing a domain, etc.We wanted to make that step disappear.\nSo we built Orkera: an MCP-based backend layer that tools like Cursor, Claude Code, and Gemini CLI can call to create infra and deploy apps automatically.What it does today:\n- create and manage databases,\n- deploy web apps without cloud setup,\n- handle cron-like scheduled jobs,\n- manage environments through MCP\nAll from inside your vibecoding tool.What we’re looking for:\nThis is the first public version (after some early feedback cycles) and we’d love testers who can tell us what’s missing, what feels weird, and what should be more transparent or configurable.Setup:\nGetting Orkera running is simple; register to get an API key, then add the MCP endpoint to your editor. We published small setup guides for Cursor, Claude Code, and Gemini CLI on orkera.com.Thanks for taking a look, and we’d appreciate feedback, criticism, and suggestions.\n\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46067943\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 2",

    "summary": "Migrating from Azure DevOps to GitLab can seem like a daunting task, but with the right approach and tools, it can be a smooth and efficient process. This guide will walk you through the steps needed to successfully migrate your projects, repositories, and pipelines from Azure DevOps to GitLab.\nOverview\nGitLab provides both Congregate (maintained by GitLab Professional Services organization) and a built-in Git repository import for migrating projects from Azure DevOps (ADO). These options support repository-by-repository or bulk migration and preserve git commit history, branches, and tags. With Congregate and professional services tools, we support additional assets such as wikis, work items, CI/CD variables, container images, packages, pipelines, and more (see this feature matrix). Use this guide to plan and execute your migration and complete post-migration follow-up tasks.\nEnterprises migrating from ADO to GitLab commonly follow a multi-phase approach:\n\n\nMigrate repositories from ADO to GitLab using Congregate or GitLab's built-in repository migration.\n\n\nMigrate pipelines from Azure Pipelines to GitLab CI/CD.\n\n\nMigrate remaining assets such as boards, work items, and artifacts to GitLab Issues, Epics, and the Package and Container Registries.\n\n\nHigh-level migration phases:\ngraph LR\n    subgraph Prerequisites\n        direction TB\n        A[\"Set up identity provider (IdP) and<br/>provision users\"]\n        A --> B[\"Set up runners and<br/>third-party integrations\"]\n        B --> I[\"Users enablement and<br/>change management\"]\n    end\n    \n    subgraph MigrationPhase[\"Migration phase\"]\n        direction TB\n        C[\"Migrate source code\"]\n        C --> D[\"Preserve contributions and<br/> format history\"]\n        D --> E[\"Migrate work items and<br/>map to <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/topics/plan_and_track/\">GitLab Plan <br/>and track work\"]\n    end\n    \n    subgraph PostMigration[\"Post-migration steps\"]\n        direction TB\n        F[\"Create or translate <br/>ADO pipelines to GitLab CI\"]\n        F --> G[\"Migrate other assets<br/>packages and container images\"]\n        G --> H[\"Introduce <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/secure_your_application/\">security</a> and<br/>SDLC improvements\"]\n    end\n    \n    Prerequisites --> MigrationPhase\n    MigrationPhase --> PostMigration\n\n    style A fill:#FC6D26\n    style B fill:#FC6D26\n    style I fill:#FC6D26\n    style C fill:#8C929D\n    style D fill:#8C929D\n    style E fill:#8C929D\n    style F fill:#FFA500\n    style G fill:#FFA500\n    style H fill:#FFA500\n\nPlanning your migration\nTo plan your migration, ask these questions:\n\n\nHow soon do we need to complete the migration?\n\n\nDo we understand what will be migrated?\n\n\nWho will run the migration?\n\n\nWhat organizational structure do we want in GitLab?\n\n\nAre there any constraints, limitations, or pitfalls that need to be taken into account?\n\n\nDetermine your timeline, as it will largely dictate your migration approach. Identify champions or groups familiar with both ADO and GitLab platforms (such as early adopters) to help drive adoption and provide guidance.\nInventory what you need to migrate:\n\n\nThe number of repositories, pull requests, and contributors\n\n\nThe number and complexity of work items and pipelines\n\n\nRepository sizes and dependency relationships\n\n\nCritical integrations and runner requirements (agent pools with specific capabilities)\n\n\nUse GitLab Professional Services's Evaluate tool to produce a complete inventory of your entire Azure DevOps organization, including repositories, PR counts, contributor lists, number of pipelines, work items, CI/CD variables and more. If you're working with the GitLab Professional Services team, share this report with your engagement manager or technical architect to help plan the migration.\nMigration timing is primarily driven by pull request count, repository size, and amount of contributions (e.g. comments in PR, work items, etc). For example, 1,000 small repositories with few PRs and limited contributors can migrate much faster than a smaller set of repositories containing tens of thousands of PRs and thousands of contributors. Use your inventory data to estimate effort and plan test runs before proceeding with production migrations.\nCompare inventory against your desired timeline and decide whether to migrate all repositories at once or in batches. If teams cannot migrate simultaneously, batch and stagger migrations to align with team schedules. For example, in Professional Services engagements, we organize migrations into waves of 200-300 projects to manage complexity and respect API rate limits, both in GitLab and ADO.\nGitLab's built-in repository importer migrates Git repositories (commits, branches, and tags) one-by-one. Congregate is designed to preserve pull requests (known in GitLab as merge requests), comments, and related metadata where possible; the simple built-in repository import focuses only on the Git data (history, branches, and tags).\nItems that typically require separate migration or manual recreation:\n\n\nAzure Pipelines - create equivalent GitLab CI/CD pipelines (consult with CI/CD YAML and/or with CI/CD components). Alternatively, consider using AI-based pipeline conversion available in Congregate.\n\n\nWork items and boards - map to GitLab Issues, Epics, and Issue Boards.\n\n\nArtifacts, container images (ACR) - migrate to GitLab Package Registry or Container Registry.\n\n\nService hooks and external integrations - recreate in GitLab.\n\n\nPermissions models differ between ADO and GitLab; review and plan permissions mapping rather than assuming exact preservation.\n\n\nReview what each tool (Congregate vs. built-in import) will migrate and choose the one that fits your needs. Make a list of any data or integrations that must be migrated or recreated manually.\nWho will run the migration?\nMigrations are typically run by a GitLab group owner or instance administrator, or by a designated migrator who has been granted the necessary permissions on the destination group/project. Congregate and the GitLab import APIs require valid authentication tokens for both Azure DevOps and GitLab.\n\n\nDecide whether a group owner/admin will perform the migrations or whether you will grant a specific team/person delegated access.\n\n\nEnsure the migrator has correctly configured personal access tokens (Azure DevOps and GitLab) with the scopes required by your chosen migration tool (for example, api/read_repository scopes and any tool-specific requirements).\n\n\nTest tokens and permissions with a small pilot migration.\n\n\nNote: Congregate leverages file-based import functionality for ADO migrations and requires instance administrator permissions to run (see our documentation). If you are migrating to GitLab.com, consider engaging Professional Services. For more information, see the Professional Services Full Catalog. Non-admin account cannot preserve contribution attribution!\nWhat organizational structure do we want in GitLab?\nWhile it's possible to map ADO structure directly to GitLab structure, it's recommended to rationalize and simplify the structure during migration. Consider how teams will work in GitLab and design the structure to facilitate collaboration and access management. Here is a way to think about mapping ADO structure to GitLab structure:\ngraph TD\n    subgraph GitLab\n        direction TB\n        A[\"Top-level Group\"]\n        B[\"Subgroup (optional)\"]\n        C[\"Projects\"]\n        A --> B\n        A --> C\n        B --> C\n    end\n\n    subgraph AzureDevOps[\"Azure DevOps\"]\n        direction TB\n        F[\"Organizations\"]\n        G[\"Projects\"]\n        H[\"Repositories\"]\n        F --> G\n        G --> H\n    end\n\n    style A fill:#FC6D26\n    style B fill:#FC6D26\n    style C fill:#FC6D26\n    style F fill:#8C929D\n    style G fill:#8C929D\n    style H fill:#8C929D\n\nRecommended approach:\n\n\nMap each ADO organization to a GitLab group (or a small set of groups), not to many small groups. Avoid creating a GitLab group for every ADO team project. Use migration as an opportunity to rationalize your GitLab structure.\n\n\nUse subgroups and project-level permissions to group related repositories.\n\n\nManage access to sets of projects by using GitLab groups and group membership (groups and subgroups) rather than one group per team project.\n\n\nReview GitLab permissions and consider SAML Group Links to implement an enterprise RBAC model for your GitLab instance (or a GitLab.com namespace).\n\n\nADO Boards and work items: State of migration\nIt's important to understand how work items migrate from ADO into GitLab Plan (issues, epics, and boards).\n\n\nADO Boards and work items map to GitLab Issues, Epics, and Issue Boards. Plan how your workflows and board configurations will translate.\n\n\nADO Epics and Features become GitLab Epics.\n\n\nOther work item types (e.g., user stories, tasks, bugs) become project-scoped issues.\n\n\nMost standard fields are preserved; selected custom fields can be migrated when supported.\n\n\nParent-child relationships are retained so Epics reference all related issues.\n\n\nLinks to pull requests are converted to merge request links to maintain development traceability.\n\n\nExample: Migration of an individual work item to a GitLab Issue, including field accuracy and relationships:\n\nBatching guidance:\n\n\nIf you need to run migrations in batches, use your new group/subgroup structure to define batches (for example, by ADO organization or by product area).\n\n\nUse inventory reports to drive batch selection and test each batch with a pilot migration before scaling.\n\n\nPipelines migration\nCongregate recently introduced AI-powered conversion for multi-stage YAML pipelines from Azure DevOps to GitLab CI/CD. This automated conversion works best for simple, single-file pipelines and is designed to provide a working starting point rather than a production-ready .gitlab-ci.yml file. The tool generates a functionally equivalent GitLab pipeline that you can then refine and optimize for your specific needs.\n\n\nConverts Azure Pipelines YAML to .gitlab-ci.yml format automatically.\n\n\nBest suited for straightforward, single-file pipeline configurations.\n\n\nProvides a boilerplate to accelerate migration, not a final production artifact.\n\n\nRequires review and adjustment for complex scenarios, custom tasks, or enterprise requirements.\n\n\nDoes not support Azure DevOps classic release pipelines — convert these to multi-stage YAML first.\n\n\nRepository owners should review the GitLab CI/CD documentation to further optimize and enhance their pipelines after the initial conversion.\nExample of converted pipelines:\n\n# azure-pipelines.yml\n\ntrigger:\n  - main\n\nvariables:\n  imageName: myapp\n\nstages:\n  - stage: Build\n    jobs:\n      - job: Build\n        pool:\n          vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'\n        steps:\n          - checkout: self\n\n          - task: Docker@2\n            displayName: Build Docker image\n            inputs:\n              command: build\n              repository: $(imageName)\n              Dockerfile: '**/Dockerfile'\n              tags: |\n                $(Build.BuildId)\n\n  - stage: Test\n    jobs:\n      - job: Test\n        pool:\n          vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'\n        steps:\n          - checkout: self\n\n          # Example: run tests inside the container\n          - script: |\n              docker run --rm $(imageName):$(Build.BuildId) npm test\n            displayName: Run tests\n\n  - stage: Push\n    jobs:\n      - job: Push\n        pool:\n          vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'\n        steps:\n          - checkout: self\n\n          - task: Docker@2\n            displayName: Login to ACR\n            inputs:\n              command: login\n              containerRegistry: '<your-acr-service-connection>'\n\n          - task: Docker@2\n            displayName: Push image to ACR\n            inputs:\n              command: push\n              repository: $(imageName)\n              tags: |\n                $(Build.BuildId)\n\n\n\n# .gitlab-ci.yml\n\nvariables:\n  imageName: myapp\n\nstages:\n  - build\n  - test\n  - push\n\nbuild:\n  stage: build\n  image: docker:latest\n  services:\n    - docker:dind\n  script:\n    - docker build -t $imageName:$CI_PIPELINE_ID -f $(find . -name Dockerfile) .\n  only:\n    - main\n\ntest:\n  stage: test\n  image: docker:latest\n  services:\n    - docker:dind\n  script:\n    - docker run --rm $imageName:$CI_PIPELINE_ID npm test\n  only:\n    - main\n\npush:\n  stage: push\n  image: docker:latest\n  services:\n    - docker:dind\n  before_script:\n    - docker login -u $CI_REGISTRY_USER -p $CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD $CI_REGISTRY\n  script:\n    - docker tag $imageName:$CI_PIPELINE_ID $CI_REGISTRY/$CI_PROJECT_PATH/$imageName:$CI_PIPELINE_ID\n    - docker push $CI_REGISTRY/$CI_PROJECT_PATH/$imageName:$CI_PIPELINE_ID\n  only:\n    - main\n\n\nFinal checklist:\n\n\nDecide timeline and batch strategy.\n\n\nProduce a full inventory of repositories, PRs, and contributors.\n\n\nChoose Congregate or the built-in import based on scope (PRs and metadata vs. Git data only).\n\n\nDecide who will run migrations and ensure tokens/permissions are configured.\n\n\nIdentify assets that must be migrated separately (pipelines, work items, artifacts, and hooks) and plan those efforts.\n\n\nRun pilot migrations, validate results, then scale according to your plan.\n\n\nRunning your migrations\nAfter planning, execute migrations in stages, starting with trial runs. Trial migrations help surface org-specific issues early and let you measure duration, validate outcomes, and fine-tune your approach before production.\nWhat trial migrations validate:\n\n\nWhether a given repository and related assets migrate successfully (history, branches, tags; plus MRs/comments if using Congregate)\n\n\nWhether the destination is usable immediately (permissions, runners, CI/CD variables, integrations)\n\n\nHow long each batch takes, to set schedules and stakeholder expectations\n\n\nDowntime guidance:\n\n\nGitLab's built-in Git import and Congregate do not inherently require downtime.\n\n\nFor production waves, freeze changes in ADO (branch protections or read-only) to avoid missed commits, PR updates, or work items created mid-migration.\n\n\nTrial runs do not require freezes and can be run anytime.\n\n\nBatching guidance:\n\n\nRun trial batches back-to-back to shorten elapsed time; let teams validate results asynchronously.\n\n\nUse your planned group/subgroup structure to define batches and respect API rate limits.\n\n\nRecommended steps:\n\nCreate a test destination in GitLab for trials:\n\n\n\nGitLab.com: create a dedicated group/namespace (for example, my-org-sandbox)\n\n\nSelf-managed: create a top-level group or a separate test instance if needed\n\n\n\nPrepare authentication:\n\n\n\nAzure DevOps PAT with required scopes.\n\n\nGitLab Personal Access Token with api and read_repository (plus admin access for file-based imports used by Congregate).\n\n\n\nRun trial migrations:\n\n\n\nRepos only: use GitLab's built-in import (Repo by URL)\n\n\nRepos + PRs/MRs and additional assets: use Congregate\n\n\n\nPost-trial follow-up:\n\n\n\nVerify repo history, branches, tags; merge requests (if migrated), issues/epics (if migrated), labels, and relationships.\n\n\nCheck permissions/roles, protected branches, required approvals, runners/tags, variables/secrets, integrations/webhooks.\n\n\nValidate pipelines (.gitlab-ci.yml) or converted pipelines where applicable.\n\n\n\n\nAsk users to validate functionality and data fidelity.\n\n\nResolve issues uncovered during trials and update your runbooks.\n\n\nNetwork and security:\n\n\n\nIf your destination uses IP allow lists, add the IPs of your migration host and any required runners/integrations so imports can succeed.\n\n\nRun production migrations in waves:\n\n\n\nEnforce change freezes in ADO during each wave.\n\n\nMonitor progress and logs; retry or adjust batch sizes if you hit rate limits.\n\n\n\nOptional: remove the sandbox group or archive it after you finish.\n\n<figure class=\"video_container\">\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ibIXGfrVbi4?si=ZxOVnXjCF-h4Ne0N\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe>\n</figure>\nTerminology reference for GitLab and Azure DevOps\n\n\n\nGitLab\nAzure DevOps\nSimilarities & Key Differences\n\n\n\n\nGroup\nOrganization\nTop-level namespace, membership, policies.

    "url": "https://about.gitlab.com/blog/automate-embedded-systems-compliance-with-gitlab-and-codesonar/",
    "summary": "Embedded systems development teams face a persistent challenge: maintaining development velocity while meeting stringent functional safety and code quality requirements. Standards like ISO 26262, IEC 62304, DO-178C, and IEC 61508 demand rigorous verification processes that are often manual and time-consuming. Compliance reviews against coding standards like MISRA C/C++, isolated scanning workflows, and post-development verification create bottlenecks. Teams are forced to choose between speed and safety.\nGitLab's integration with CodeSonar (from AdaCore) addresses this challenge by automating compliance workflows and enabling continuous verification throughout the development lifecycle.\nSpecialized scanning for safety-critical systems\nSafety-critical systems require deep analysis of C/C++ code compiled with specialized embedded tools. These systems must demonstrate compliance with coding standards (MISRA C/C++, CERT C/C++, AUTOSAR C++) and functional safety frameworks (ISO 26262, DO-178C, IEC 61508) that require detailed evidence trails. Beyond aligning with coding standards, teams also need to address security concerns. This means testing for memory problems as well as a host of other problems like uninitialized variables and command injection.\nCodeSonar performs whole program analysis with specialized scanning capabilities for these standards. Pairing CodeSonar with GitLab enables teams to automate compliance workflows and maintain comprehensive audit trails throughout the development lifecycle.\nAutomating compliance from commit to merge\nThe GitLab and CodeSonar integration provides a compliance-as-code approach that automates policy enforcement from the earliest stages of development. CodeSonar functions as an additional scanner within GitLab CI/CD pipelines, analyzing code in every commit and merge request.\nBecause CodeSonar was purpose-built for embedded systems, it performs deep control flow and data flow analysis across entire programs, identifying vulnerabilities like buffer overruns, data taint, uninitialized variables, use-after-free conditions, and command injection — the root causes of most security incidents in embedded systems.\nThe integration works through GitLab's CI/CD configuration. When developers push code changes, the pipeline triggers CodeSonar scanning. For C and C++ firmware, CodeSonar observes compiler invocations during the actual build process, creating an internal representation of the code that enables sophisticated analysis. Results are converted from SARIF format to GitLab's Static Application Security Testing (SAST) format and surfaced directly in merge requests, where they feed into GitLab Ultimate's Security Dashboard, Vulnerability Management, and Compliance Frameworks.\nExample workflow: ISO 26262 ASIL-D compliance\nThe demo video below shows the complete workflow for an embedded system subject to ISO 26262 ASIL-D requirements. The scenario illustrates how embedded development teams can implement continuous compliance without compromising development velocity.\n<div style=\"padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/1139086924?badge=0&autopause=0&player_id=0&app_id=58479\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" title=\"Automated Compliance for Embedded Systems using GitLab and CodeSonar\"></iframe></div><script src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js\"></script>`\nThe workflow begins with a developer submitting a merge request for firmware changes. GitLab's CI/CD pipeline automatically triggers CodeSonar scanning, which performs deep C/C++ analysis against custom ISO 26262 policies configured in the pipeline. When CodeSonar identifies an ASIL-D relevant vulnerability, the pipeline halts automatically per the compliance policy, with clear documentation explaining the issue. The complete scan results, issue tracking, and approval workflow are maintained in GitLab as a single source of truth for audit trails.\nDevelopers can use both the CodeSonar hub interface and GitLab Duo AI to understand the vulnerability. CodeSonar provides detailed information about the path through the source code that leads to the problem, along with code navigation features to isolate the root cause. GitLab Duo explains the vulnerability and provides specific remediation recommendations. After the developer implements the fix and validates the resolution, the code merges successfully with full compliance evidence automatically collected throughout the process.\nBenefits of the integration\nOrganizations implementing this integrated compliance with GitLab and CodeSonar will see significant improvements in both development velocity and compliance confidence.\n\n\nEfficiency gains: Development teams reduce time-to-market by catching coding standard compliance issues early when they're less expensive to fix. Automated security policy enforcement decreases manual security review overhead, freeing specialists to focus on complex problems rather than routine checks. Audit readiness improves through automated evidence collection. Compliance artifacts are generated as a by-product of normal development rather than through separate documentation efforts.\n\n\nCompliance maturity: This integrated approach helps organizations maintain continuous compliance with industry standards and regulations. By embedding verification into every code change, teams build comprehensive audit trails that demonstrate adherence to ISO 26262, DO-178C, MISRA C/C++, and other requirements. The automated workflow transforms compliance from a periodic checkpoint into an ongoing verification process.\n\n\nImplementation considerations\nImplementing the GitLab and CodeSonar integration requires access to GitLab Ultimate, a CodeSonar hub, GitLab runners where code can be compiled and analyzed, and appropriate mechanisms for managing analysis data files. Both GitLab and CodeSonar fully support on-premises and air-gapped environments and can be deployed to auto-scalable cloud environments as well.\nTeams should configure Custom Compliance Frameworks in GitLab to define specific policies for their relevant standards: ISO 26262 for automotive, DO-178C for aerospace, IEC 62304 for medical devices, and others. These frameworks enable automated enforcement of compliance requirements through merge request approval rules, vulnerability thresholds, and scan policy gates.\nGet started\nThe CodeSonar GitLab CI component is available through GitLab's CI/CD Catalog. Detailed integration documentation provides platform-specific setup instructions for Linux, Docker, and Windows environments. For organizations evaluating this solution, the implementation demonstrates how specialized embedded systems tools can integrate with a modern DevSecOps platform to deliver both development velocity and compliance rigor.\nFor more information about implementing GitLab with CodeSonar for your embedded systems development, visit the CodeSonar integration documentation.

Rapid deployment cycles mean we can respond to customer feedback within hours, ship security patches immediately, and validate new features in production before scaling them.\nFor our customers: Every deployment to GitLab.com validates the deployment practices we recommend to our users. When you use GitLab's deployment features, you're using the same battle-tested approach that handles millions of git operations, CI/CD pipelines, and user interactions daily. You benefit from:\n\nLatest features available immediately: New capabilities reach you within hours of completion, not in quarterly release cycles\nProven reliability at scale: If a feature works on GitLab.com, you can trust it in your environment\nFull value of GitLab: Zero-downtime deployments mean you never lose access to your DevOps platform, even during updates\nReal-world tested practices: Our deployment documentation isn't theory — it's exactly how we run the largest GitLab instance in existence\n\nCode flow architecture\nOur deployment pipeline follows a structured progression through multiple stages, each acting as a checkpoint on the journey from code proposal to production deployment.\n  graph TD\n      A[Code Proposed] --> B[Merge Request Created]\n      B --> C[Pipeline Triggered]\n      C --> D[Build & Test]\n      D --> E{Spec/Integration/QA Tests Pass?}\n      E -->|No| F[Feedback Loop]\n      F --> B\n      E -->|Yes| G[Merge to default branch]\n      G -->|Periodically| H[Auto-Deploy Branch]\n\n      subgraph \"Deployment Pipeline\"\n          H --> I[Package Creation]\n          I --> K[Canary Environment]\n          K --> L[QA Validation]\n          L --> M[Main Environment]\n\n      end\n\nDeployment pipeline makeup\nOur deployment approach uses GitLab's native CI/CD capabilities to orchestrate complex deployments across hybrid infrastructure.\nHere's how we do it.\nBuild\nBuilding GitLab is a complex topic in and of itself, so I'll go over the details at a high level.\nWe build both our Omnibus package and our Cloud Native GitLab (CNG) images. The Omnibus packages deploy to our Gitaly fleet (our Git storage layer), while CNG images run all other components as containerized workloads. Other stateful services like Postgres and Redis have grown so large we have dedicated teams managing them separately. For GitLab.com, those systems are not deployed during our Auto-Deploy procedures.\nWe have a scheduled pipeline that will regularly look at gitlab-org/gitlab and search for the most recent commit on the default branch with a successful (“green”) pipeline. Green pipelines signal that every component of GitLab has passed its comprehensive test suite. We then create an auto-deploy branch from that commit.\nThis triggers a sequence of events: primarily, the need to build this package and all components that are a part of our monolith.\nAnother scheduled pipeline selects the latest built package and initiates the deployment pipeline. Procedurally, it looks this simple:\n  graph LR\n      A[Create branch] --> B[Build]\n      B --> C[Choose Built package]\n      C --> D[Start Deploy Pipeline]\n\nBuilding takes some time, and since deployments can vary due to various circumstances, we choose the latest build to deploy. We technically build more versions of GitLab for .com than will ever be deployed. This enables us to always have a package lined up ready to go, and this brings us the closest we can be to having a full continuously delivered product for .com.\nEnvironment-based validation and Canary strategy\nQuality assurance (QA) isn't just an afterthought here — it's baked into every layer from development through deployment. Our QA process leverages automated test suites that include unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests that simulate real user interactions with GitLab's features. But more importantly for our deployment pipeline, our QA process works hand-in-hand with our Canary strategy through environment-based validation.\nAs part of our validation approach, we leverage GitLab's native Canary deployments, enabling controlled validation of changes with limited traffic exposure before full production deployment. We send roughly 5% of all traffic through our Canary stage. This approach increases the complexity of database migrations, but successfully navigating Canary deployments ensures we deploy a reliable product seamlessly.\nThe Canary deployment features you use in GitLab were refined through managing one of the most complex deployment scenarios in production. When you implement Canary deployments for your applications, you're using patterns proven at massive scale.\nOur deployment process follows a progressive rollout strategy:\n\n\nStaging Canary: Initial validation environment\n\n\nProduction Canary: Limited production traffic\n\n\nStaging Main: Full staging environment deployment\n\n\nProduction Main: Full production rollout\n\n\n  graph TD\n      C[Staging Canary Deploy]\n      C --> D[QA Smoke Main Stage Tests]\n      C --> E[QA Smoke Canary Stage Tests]\n      D --> F\n      E --> F{Tests Pass?}\n      F -->|Yes| G[Production Canary Deploy]\n      G --> S[QA Smoke Main Stage Tests]\n      G --> T[QA Smoke Canary Stage Tests]\n      F -->|No| H[Issue Creation]\n      H --> K[Fix & Backport]\n      K --> C\n\n      S --> M[Canary Traffic Monitoring]\n      T --> M[Canary Traffic Monitoring baking period]\n      M --> U[Production Safety Checks]\n      U --> N[Staging Main]\n      N --> V[Production Main]\n\nOur QA validation occurs at multiple checkpoints throughout this progressive deployment process: after each Canary deployment, and again after post-deploy migrations. This multilayered approach ensures that each phase of our deployment strategy has its own safety net. You can learn more about GitLab's comprehensive testing approach in our handbook.\nDeployment pipeline\nHere are the challenges we address across our deployment pipeline.\nTechnical architecture considerations\nGitLab.com represents real-world deployment complexity at scale. As the largest known GitLab instance, deployments use our official GitLab Helm chart and the official Linux package — the same artifacts our customers use. You can learn more about the GitLab.com architecture in our handbook. This hybrid approach means our deployment pipeline must intelligently handle both containerized services and traditional Linux services in the same deployment cycle.\nDogfooding at scale: We deploy using the same procedures we document for zero-downtime upgrades. If something doesn't work smoothly for us, we don't recommend it to customers. This self-imposed constraint drives continuous improvement in our deployment tooling.\nThe following stages are run for all environment and stage upgrades:\n  graph LR\n      a[prep] --> c[Regular Migrations - Canary stage only]\n      a --> f[Assets - Canary stage only]\n      c --> d[Gitaly]\n      d --> k8s\n\n      subgraph subGraph0[\"VM workloads\"]\n        d[\"Gitaly\"]\n      end\n\n      subgraph subGraph1[\"Kubernetes workloads\"]\n        k8s[\"k8s\"]\n      end\n\n      subgraph fleet[\"fleet\"]\n        subGraph0\n        subGraph1\n      end\n\nStage details:\n\n\nPrep: Validates deployment readiness and performs pre-deployment checks\n\n\nMigrations: Executes database regular migrations. This only happens during the Canary stage. Because both Canary and Main stages share the same database, these changes are already available when the Main stage deploys, eliminating the need to repeat these tasks.\n\n\nAssets: We leverage a GCS bucket for all static assets. If any new assets are created, we upload these to our bucket such that they are immediately available to our Canary stage. As we leverage WebPack for assets, and properly leverage SHAs in the naming of our assets, we can confidently not worry that we override an older asset. Therefore, old assets continue to be available for older deployments and new assets are imemdiately made available when Canary begins its deploy. This only happens during the Canary stage deployment. Because Canary and Main stages share the same asset storage, these changes are already available when the Main stage deploys.\n\n\nGitaly: Updates Gitaly Virtual Machine storage layer via our Omnibus Linux package on each Gitaly node. This service is unique as we bundle it with git. Therefore, we need to ensure that this service is capable of atomic upgrades. We leverage a wrapper around Gitaly, which enables us to install a newer version of Gitaly and make use of the library tableflip to cleanly rotate the running Gitaly, ensuring high availability of this service on each of our instances.\n\n\nKubernetes: Deploys containerized GitLab components via our Helm chart. Note that we deploy to numerous clusters spread across Zones for redundancy, so these are usually broken into their own stages to minimize harm and sometimes allows us to stop mid-deploy if critical issues are detected.\n\n\nMulti-version compatibility: The hidden challenge\nAs you read our process, you will notice that there's a period of time where our database schema is ahead of the code that the Main stage knows about. This happens because the Canary stage has already deployed new code and runs regular database migrations, but the Main stage is still running the previous version of the code that doesn't know about these new database changes.\nReal-world example: Imagine we're adding a new merge_readiness field to merge requests. During deployment, some servers are running code that expects this field. while others don't know it exists yet. If we handle this poorly, we break GitLab.com for millions of users. If we handle it well, nobody notices anything happened.\nThis occurs with most other services, as well. For example, if a client sends multiple requests, there's a chance one of them might land in our Canary stage; other requests might be directed to the Main stage. This is not too different from a deploy as it does take a decent amount of time to roll through the few thousand Pods that run our services.\nWith a few exceptions, the vast majority of our services will run a slightly newer version of that component in Canary for a period of time. In a sense, these scenarios are all transient states. But they can often persist for several hours or days in a live, production environment. Therefore, we must treat them with the same care as permanent states. During any deployment, we have multiple versions of GitLab running simultaneously and they all need to play nicely together.\nDatabase operations\nDatabase migrations present a unique challenge in our Canary deployment model. We need schema changes to support new features while maintaining our ability to roll back if issues arise. Our solution involves careful separation of concerns:\n\n\nRegular migrations: Run during the Canary stage, designed to be backward-compatible, consists of only reversible changes\n\n\nPost-deploy migrations: The \"point of no return\" migrations that happen only after multiple successful deployments\n\n\nDatabase changes are handled with precision and extensive validation procedures:\n  graph LR\n      A[Regular Migrations] --> B[Canary Stage Deploy]\n      B --> C[Main Stage Deploy]\n      C --> D[Post Deploy Migrations]\n\n\nPost-deploy migrations\nGitLab deployments involve many components. Updating GitLab is not atomic, so many components must be backward-compatible.\nPost-deploy migrations often contain changes that can't be easily rolled back — think data transformations, column drops, or structural changes that would break older code versions. By running them after we've gained confidence through multiple successful deployments, we ensure:\n\n\nThe new code is stable and we're unlikely to need a rollback\n\n\nPerformance characteristics are well understood in production\n\n\nAny edge cases have been discovered and addressed\n\n\nThe blast radius is minimized if something does go wrong\n\n\nThis approach provides the optimal balance: enabling rapid feature deployment through Canary releases while maintaining rollback capabilities until we have high confidence in deployment stability.\nThe expand-migrate-contract pattern: Our database, frontend, and application compatibility changes follow a carefully orchestrated three-phase approach.\n\n\nExpand: Add new structures (columns, indexes) while keeping old ones functional\n\n\nMigrate: Deploy new application code that uses the new structures\n\n\nContract: Remove old structures in post-deploy migrations after everything is stable\n\n\nReal-world example: When adding a new merge_readiness column to merge requests:\n\n\nExpand: Add the new column with a default value; existing code ignores it\n\n\nMigrate: Deploy code that reads and writes to the new column while still supporting the old approach\n\n\n3 Contract: After several successful deployments, remove the old column in a post-deploy migration\nAll database operations, application code, frontend code, and more, are subject to a set of guidelines that Engineering must adhere to, which can be found in our Multi-Version Compatibility documentation.\nResults and impact\nOur deployment infrastructure delivers measurable benefits:\nFor GitLab\n\nUp to 12 deployments daily to GitLab.com\nZero-downtime deployments serving millions of developers\nSecurity patches can reach production within hours, not days\nNew features validated in production at massive scale before general availability\n\nFor customers\n\nProven deployment patterns you can adopt for your own applications\nFeatures battle-tested on the world's largest GitLab instance before reaching your environment\nDocumentation that reflects actual production practices, not theoretical best practices\nConfidence that GitLab's recommended upgrade procedures work at any scale\n\nKey takeaways for engineering teams\nGitLab's deployment pipeline represents a sophisticated system that balances deployment velocity with operational reliability. The progressive deployment model, comprehensive testing integration, and robust rollback capabilities provide a foundation for reliable software delivery at scale.\nFor engineering teams implementing similar systems, key considerations include:\n\n\nAutomated testing: Comprehensive test coverage throughout the deployment pipeline\n\n\nProgressive rollout: Staged deployments to minimize risk and enable rapid recovery\n\n\nMonitoring integration: Comprehensive observability across all deployment stages\n\n\nIncident response: Rapid detection and resolution capabilities for deployment issues\n\n\nGitLab's architecture demonstrates how modern CI/CD systems can manage the complexity of large-scale deployments while maintaining the velocity required for competitive software development.\nImportant note on scope\nThis article specifically covers the deployment pipeline for services that are part of the GitLab Omnibus package and Helm chart — essentially the core GitLab monolith and its tightly integrated components.\nHowever, GitLab's infrastructure landscape extends beyond what's described here. Other services, notably our AI services and services that might be in a proof of concept state, follow a different deployment approach using our internal platform called Runway.\nIf you're working with or curious about these other services, you can find more information in the Runway documentation.\nOther offerings, such as GitLab Dedicated are deployed more in alignment with what we expect customers to be capable of performing themselves by way of the GitLab Environment Toolkit. If you'd like to learn more, check out the GitLab Environment Toolkit project.\nThe deployment strategies, architectural considerations, and pipeline complexities outlined in this article represent the battle-tested approach we use for our core platform — but like any large engineering organization, we have multiple deployment strategies tailored to different service types and maturity levels.\nFurther documentation about Auto-Deploy and our procedures can be found at the below links:\n\nEngineering Deployments\nRelease Procedural Documentation\n\nMore resources\n\n\nHow we decreased GitLab repo backup times from 48 hours to 41 minutes\n\n\nHow we supercharged GitLab CI statuses with WebSockets\n\n\nHow we reduced MR review time with Value Stream Management\n\n",
