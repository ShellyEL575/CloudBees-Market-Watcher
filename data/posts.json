    "summary": "I built an offline-first AI system designed for places where you need expert guidance but can't rely on connectivity or cloud APIs — disaster response, remote clinics, field operations.\nThe core idea: instead of trusting the model to behave, you cage it. The system uses a dual-model pipeline (worker generates, auditor checks) governed by a policy engine that defines what's allowed before inference runs. Every interaction gets logged to an append-only audit trail with checksum chaining.\nKey design constraints:Offline-first with graceful fallback\nPolicy-driven toggles (operators set capacity limits, not AI behavior)\nTiered key overrides for credentialed users (a nurse sees different options than a paramedic)\nModular \"packs\" for different domains (medical triage, structural assessment, water safety, etc.)This started as a question: how would you deploy AI to a hurricane aftermath where there's no internet, no experts, and high stakes? The answer wasn't \"better prompts\" — it was architecture that assumes the model will try to do things it shouldn't.\nhttps://github.com/thepoorsatitagain/Tutor-to-disaster-exper...\nLooking for feedback on the architecture. I'm not from an AI background — I came at this from the ops/deployment side — so I'm sure there are things I'm missing.\n\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46599801\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

    "summary": "We currently utilize GitLab CI/CD pipelines to deploy our Kubernetes clusters. I am planning to integrate AI agents to gather cluster-related data and automate the deployment process. I am considering two primary approaches:Replacing GitLab CI/CD with Agentic Workflows: Is this a reliable strategy? With GitLab, we can easily rerun a pipeline from the point of failure after fixing an issue. I am concerned that agentic workflows might lack this granular state management and retry capability.Invoking GitLab CI/CD via Agents: In this scenario, the agent would trigger the GitLab API to start a pipeline or job. However, this seems to add more complexity than simply triggering them manually. How can I implement this efficiently?Ultimately, my goal is to use agents to eliminate manual pre-pipeline preparation and to have them autonomously analyze and fix errors when a pipeline fails. Has anyone successfully implemented AI agents for this purpose?\n\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46597509\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 2",

    "summary": "I built an offline-first AI system designed for places where you need expert guidance but can't rely on connectivity or cloud APIs — disaster response, remote clinics, field operations.\nThe core idea: instead of trusting the model to behave, you cage it. The system uses a dual-model pipeline (worker generates, auditor checks) governed by a policy engine that defines what's allowed before inference runs. Every interaction gets logged to an append-only audit trail with checksum chaining.\nKey design constraints:Offline-first with graceful fallback\nPolicy-driven toggles (operators set capacity limits, not AI behavior)\nTiered key overrides for credentialed users (a nurse sees different options than a paramedic)\nModular \"packs\" for different domains (medical triage, structural assessment, water safety, etc.)This started as a question: how would you deploy AI to a hurricane aftermath where there's no internet, no experts, and high stakes? The answer wasn't \"better prompts\" — it was architecture that assumes the model will try to do things it shouldn't.\nhttps://github.com/thepoorsatitagain/Tutor-to-disaster-exper...\nLooking for feedback on the architecture.

With GitLab, we can easily rerun a pipeline from the point of failure after fixing an issue. I am concerned that agentic workflows might lack this granular state management and retry capability.Invoking GitLab CI/CD via Agents: In this scenario, the agent would trigger the GitLab API to start a pipeline or job. However, this seems to add more complexity than simply triggering them manually. How can I implement this efficiently?Ultimately, my goal is to use agents to eliminate manual pre-pipeline preparation and to have them autonomously analyze and fix errors when a pipeline fails.

    "summary": "We’re excited to announce the general availability of GitLab Duo Agent Platform. This is an important moment for GitLab, our customers and the industry at large. It is our first step in delivering our vision to bring agentic AI into the entire software development lifecycle.AI tools have been rapidly improving developers’ ability to write code, and in some cases, developers are reporting 10x productivity gains. Unfortunately, since only about 20% of a developer’s time is spent writing code, the associated improvement in total innovation velocity and delivery gained by AI is incremental. This is often described as the AI paradox in software delivery.In addition, for many teams, increasing the speed of code authoring has led to new bottlenecks including a larger backlog of code reviews, security vulnerabilities, compliance checks and downstream bug fixes.GitLab Duo Agent Platform addresses the AI paradox by unlocking intelligent orchestration and agentic AI automation across the software lifecycle.Learn more in this video, and read more below.💡 Join GitLab Transcend on February 10 to learn how agentic AI transforms software delivery. Hear from customers and discover how to jumpstart your own modernization journey. Register now.We're also excited to announce that GitLab customers with active GitLab Premium and Ultimate subscriptions are being credited with $12 and $24 dollars, respectively, in GitLab Credits per user at no additional cost.* These credits will refresh every month and give users access to all GitLab Duo Agent Platform features.Here is a simple explanation for how GitLab Credits work: a GitLab Credit is a virtual currency used for GitLab’s usage-based products. GitLab Duo Agent Platform usage will draw down on available credits, starting with the included credits mentioned above. From there, customers can decide to commit to a shared pool of credits for their entire organization, or pay for them monthly, on demand. For more information, please check out our article introducing GitLab Credits.Customers of GitLab Duo Pro or Duo Enterprise subscriptions are welcome to continue using those products, or migrate to Duo Agent Platform at any time. The remainder of your Duo Enterprise contract value can be converted into GitLab Credits at any time. Contact your GitLab representative to learn more.Here are exciting use cases and capabilities you can try today:A unified experience for human and agent collaborationGitLab Duo Agent Platform introduces a unified user experience designed for seamless integration between humans and their AI agents inside GitLab. Developers and their teams can engage Duo Agentic Chat on nearly every page, ask questions contextually, follow async agentic sessions and interact with agents within familiar workflows like issues, merge requests, and pipeline activities — making AI actions transparent and easy to guide through everyday work.Agentic Chat: Intelligent, context-aware assistanceGitlab Duo Agentic Chat brings true multi-step reasoning across the GitLab Web UI and IDEs, using full lifecycle context from issues, merge requests, pipelines, security findings, and more. Building on the previously released Duo Chat, Agentic Chat can perform actions on your behalf autonomously and help you answer complex questions more comprehensively. It gives every member of the software team accurate, context-aware guidance that helps improve onboarding, code quality, and delivery speed.GitLab Duo Agentic Chat supports numerous use cases to enable developer <> AI collaboration. For additional details on how to get started, please see our \"Getting started with GitLab Duo Agent Platform\" guide and check out this growing set of suggested prompts.Analyze\nIn the Web UI, Agentic Chat can create issues, epics, merge requests, and provide summaries, highlight key findings, and offer actionable guidance based on real-time context from the specific project, issue, epic, merge request, and more. Agentic Chat helps developers understand unfamiliar code, dependencies, architecture, and project structure, in the IDE or inside a GitLab repo.Code\nAgentic Chat can generate code, configurations, and infrastructure-as-code across a wide range of languages and frameworks. It can help fix bugs, modernize architecture and code, generate tests, and produce documentation for faster onboarding. Directly at developers' fingertips, Agentic Chat is their collaboration partner in VS Code, JetBrains IDEs, Cursor, and Windsurf, with optional user- and workspace-level rules to tailor responses.CI/CD\nAgentic Chat can help you better understand, configure, and troubleshoot existing pipelines, or create new ones from scratch.Secure\nAgentic Chat can explain vulnerabilities, prioritize issues based on reachability, and recommend fixes that can help save you time.Agents: Specialists that collaborate on demandGitLab Duo Agent Platform enables developers to delegate tasks to specialized agents. The platform offers a unique combination of foundational, custom, and external agents, all seamlessly integrated into GitLab user experience, making it easy to choose the right agent for any task.Foundational agents are pre-built by GitLab experts and are ready out-of-the-box to handle the most complex tasks in the software delivery cycle. The following foundational agents are included as part of GitLab Duo Agent Platform’s general availability, with others currently in beta and coming soon.Planner Agent helps teams structure, prioritize, and break down work directly inside GitLab so planning becomes clearer, faster, and easier to act on.Security Analyst Agent reviews vulnerabilities and security signals, explains their impact in plain language, and helps teams understand what to address first.Custom agents can be built using the AI Catalog, a central repository where teams create, publish, manage, and share custom agents and flows across the organization. Teams can create agents and flows with specific context and capabilities to replicate the way their engineering team works — and tackle problems using the engineering standards and guardrails their engineers use.External agents are seamlessly integrated into GitLab and include some of the very best AI tools available, including Claude Code from Anthropic and Codex CLI from OpenAI. Users will enjoy native GitLab access to these tools for use cases like code generation, code review, and analysis with transparent security and embedded LLM subscriptions.Together, these approaches give teams flexibility in how they adopt agentic AI, from specialized agents, to organization-specific automation, to integrating external AI tools — all within a single, governed platform.Flows: Turning multi-step work into repeatable, guided progressFlows automate complex tasks with multiple agentic workflows, from start to finish.Our engineering team has built several flows included at GA, with more on the way:Developer (Issue to Merge Request) flow builds a structured MR from a well-defined issue so teams can begin work immediately.Convert to GitLab CI/CD flow helps teams migrate or modernize pipeline configurations without manual rewriting.Fix CI/CD pipeline flow analyzes failures, identifies likely causes, and prepares recommended changes.Code Review flow analyzes code changes, merge request comments, and more to streamline code reviews with AI-native analysis and feedback.Software development in IDE flow guides work through everyday development and review stages.MCP Client: Connect GitLab Duo Agent Platform to the tools your teams already useThe MCP Client enables GitLab Duo Agent Platform in IDEs to securely connect to external systems like Jira, Slack, Confluence, and other MCP-compatible tools to pull in context and take action across your DevSecOps toolchain.Instead of AI assistance being siloed inside individual tools, the MCP Client allows GitLab Duo Agent Platform to understand and operate across the systems where planning, collaboration, and execution actually happen. This reduces manual context switching and enables more complete, end-to-end AI-powered workflows that reflect how teams work in practice.Included at GA:Connection to external MCP-compatible systems such as Jira, Confluence, Slack, Playwright, and GrafanaConfiguration at the workspace and user levelGroup-level controls to enable or restrict MCP usageUser approval flow for tool accessSupport across Agentic Chat in the IDE extensionsWe plan to add more features to the GitLab MCP server capability, which is currently in beta, and make it generally available in upcoming releases.Choose the right model for your team and workloadsGitLab Duo Agent Platform is built on a flexible model selection framework that enables teams to tailor the platform to align with their privacy, security, and compliance needs. GitLab defaults to an optimal LLM for each feature, but administrators have the option to select from supported models such as OpenAI GPT-5 variants, Mistral, Meta Llama, and Anthropic Claude. This gives teams more precise control and flexibility over what is used for chat, coding tasks, and agent interactions for each specific use case, based on your organization’s standards. For a full list of supported models and details on model section configuration, see the Model Selection section of our documentation.Governance, visibility, and deployment flexibilityThe GitLab Duo Agent Platform gives organizations the control and transparency they need to help them adopt AI responsibly, while offering flexible deployment options that work across different environments.Included at GA:Available on all platforms: GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, and GitLab Dedicated as part of the GitLab 18.8 release cycle.Governance and visibility: Teams can see how agents are used, what actions they perform, and how they contribute to work. Usage and activity details help leaders understand adoption, measure impact, and ensure AI is being used appropriately. These controls make it easier to roll out AI at scale with confidence.Group-based access controls: Administrators can define namespace-level rules governing which users can access GitLab Duo Agent Platform features, supporting flexible adoption from immediate organization-wide enablement to phased rollouts. With LDAP and SAML integration, they can enable governance at scale without manual configuration.Model selection and self-hosted options: LLM selection is available for all GA features across GitLab.com, Self-Managed, and Dedicated. Top-level namespace owners choose the model, and subgroups inherit those settings automatically. For organizations that want more control, the platform supports self-hosted models for GitLab Self-Managed deployments.Watch a demo of GitLab Duo Agent Platform in action:Stay up to date with GitLabTo make sure you’re getting the latest features, security updates, and performance improvements, we recommend keeping your GitLab instance up to date. The following resources can help you plan and complete your upgrade:Upgrade Path Tool – enter your current version and see the exact upgrade steps for your instanceUpgrade Documentation – detailed guides for each supported version, including requirements, step-by-step instructions, and best practicesBy upgrading regularly, you’ll ensure your team benefits from the newest GitLab capabilities and remains secure and supported.For organizations that want a hands-off approach, consider GitLab’s Managed Maintenance service.

    "url": "https://about.gitlab.com/blog/introducing-gitlab-credits/",
    "summary": "We built GitLab Credits because seat-based pricing for agentic AI was not making sense.Seat-based pricing creates AI “haves\" and \"have-nots” for engineering teams, a fundamental misalignment with the way that modern agentic AI should be used across the software development lifecycle. Today, you have to buy a seat for every individual before they can start using AI. While this works for the few heavy users, it can be too expensive and unfair for the majority of the team with light or spiky usage. That's why in many organizations, only a portion of the team gets to have an “AI seat.\"Add to that, GitLab Duo Agent Platform is different from Duo Pro, Duo Enterprise, and other AI developer tools in the market. Agents and agentic workflows can be invoked by your team when they need AI assistance and triggered by SDLC events running in the background. With Duo Agent Platform, agentic AI is no longer only tied to user seats.GitLab Credits addresses these issues as our new virtual currency for usage-based pricing, starting with GitLab Duo Agent Platform. That means, every member in your organization with a GitLab account (Premium or Ultimate) can now use agentic AI capabilities without you paying for an AI seat, whether invoked by them or set up as background agents.How GitLab Credits workGitLab Credits are pooled across your entire organization. Your GitLab Duo Agent Platform usage is drawn down from GitLab Credits. That includes both synchronous and asynchronous use of agents and agentic flows. This includes:Foundational agents such as Security Analyst, Planner, and Data AnalystFoundational flows such as Code Review, Developer, and Fix CI/CD PipelineExternal agents such as Anthropic Claude Code and OpenAI CodexCustom agents and flows you build and publish in your GitLab AI CatalogAgentic Chat in the GitLab UI and in the IDE used by your developersNote: External agents are available to try at no cost in 18.8 and do not consume GitLab Credits. We will be introducing pricing next month with our 18.9 release. Custom flows are currently in beta and do not consume GitLab Credits.The amount of credits drawn down is based on the number of agentic requests by large language models (more details here). As more LLMs become available, we will certify them for use with GitLab Duo Agent Platform and add to this list, providing customers with a transparent view of how they are consumed.The total count of GitLab Credits is calculated at the end of the month based on actual usage. This model also automatically offsets usage from power users against that of lighter users, effectively lowering your total cost of AI for every individual (as compared to paying per seat for every individual).For simplicity, each GitLab Credit has an on-demand list price of $1. You can use GitLab Duo Agent Platform without any commitments and usage is billed monthly (at the end of each month). For enterprise customers that sign up for annual commitments, we offer volume discounts for monthly credits.As a limited-time promotion*, all GitLab customers that have active Premium and Ultimate subscriptions will automatically receive $12 and $24 in included credits per user, respectively. These credits will refresh every month until the end of the promotion period and give your team access to all GitLab Duo Agent Platform features at no extra cost. When you accept our billing terms, any usage above these included credits will be billed through committed monthly credits or on-demand credits.Cost governance with GitLab CreditsSizing GitLab Credits: Your account team has a sizing calculator as part of the GA of GitLab Duo Agent Platform to estimate the number of GitLab Credits you’ll need every month. This calculator was built with usage patterns we’ve observed during the beta period. In addition, as an existing or a new customer, you can request a free trial to confirm your estimated actual usage.Usage visibility: With the 18.8 release, you have detailed usage information through two complementary dashboards — one in the GitLab Customers Portal for billing managers focused on financial oversight, and one in-product for administrators focused on operational monitoring. Both provide attribution of usage, cost breakdowns, and historical trends so you always know exactly how your credits are being consumed. If you follow a cross-charging practice internally, you’ll be able to use project- and group-level rollups for cost allocations.Usage controls: You can enable or disable GitLab Duo Agent Platform access for specific teams or projects, ensuring only approved usage can tally up to your credits. We also plan to add user-level controls shortly after GA to help you manage who can use GitLab Duo Agent Platform capabilities and draw-down credits.Automated usage notifications: We’ll proactively keep you informed about your GitLab Credit usage via email alerts when you reach 50%, 80%, and 100% of your committed monthly credits, giving you time to adjust usage, purchase additional commitments, or plan for on-demand billing.Upgrading from seat-based GitLab Duo Pro/Enterprise to GitLab Credits for Duo Agent PlatformIf you’ve purchased and are using GitLab Duo Pro and Duo Enterprise, you can keep using those capabilities as supported options. You can upgrade to GitLab Duo Agent Platform at any time and do what you can with “classic” Duo and access new capabilities such as agentic chat, additional foundational agents, custom agents and flows, external agents, and more.At the time of upgrade, we will roll forward your investment in seats for GitLab Duo Pro and Duo Enterprise to GitLab Credits for Duo Agent Platform. The remaining dollar amount of seat commitments will be exchanged for monthly GitLab Credits with volume-based discounts. The monthly GitLab Credits can then be shared across every team member in your organization you allow, not just the users who had assigned Duo seats before.Competitive comparison: GitLab Credits vs. seat-based pricingBenefitGitLab CreditsSeat-based pricingAI for everyoneEvery approved team member gets AI access from day oneCreates AI \"haves\" and \"have-nots\" — forces seat rationingNo upfront InvestmentStart small with included credits, increase commitment as ROI becomes clearMust purchase seats upfront before proving valuePay for what you useOnly the AI work actually performed above included tier is billedPay per seat regardless of actual usageOptimized spendShared credit pool allows you to offset power users with light usersMust pay for light users, overages for premium requests from power usersDetailed visibilityUsage dashboards with detailed attribution and historical trendsLimited insight into which users drive valueGranular cost controlsChoose who can access, proactive alerts, and upcoming budget controls to limitLimit who gets a seat to control costsSizing flexibilityCalculator to estimate monthly credits, with more unit discounts with volumeCount who gets a seat multiplied by price per seatSimplified contracts and billingSingle SKU and bill covers all agentic capabilities across the DevSecOps lifecycleMultiple AI licenses required across different third-party toolsGetting startedFor existing Premium/Ultimate customers: With GA, GitLab Duo Agent Platform will be available for customers with active Premium and Ultimate licenses**.

What are GitLab Credits and why did GitLab introduce them?GitLab Credits is a new virtual currency for usage-based GitLab capabilities, starting with GitLab Duo Agent Platform. GitLab introduced this model because seat-based pricing was forcing organizations to ration AI access within engineering teams, and Duo Agent Platform usage is not just tied to seats. Credits are pooled across your entire organization, allowing you to give every team member access to AI capabilities, or set up background agentic workflows, without requiring individual seat purchases upfront.2. How does credit consumption work?Credits are drawn down based on the number of agentic requests made, with different rates depending on which LLM is used. For example, you get two model requests per credit for Claude-sonnet-4.5 (the default for most features), and 20 requests per credit for models like gpt-5-mini or claude-3-haiku.3. What's included for existing Premium and Ultimate customers?As a limited-time promotion, customers with active Premium and Ultimate subscriptions automatically receive included credits free of charge alongside the GA release of Duo Agent Platform in GitLab 18.8:$12 in credits per user per month for Premium$24 in credits per user per month for UltimateIncluded credits are at a per-user level, refresh monthly, and enable access to all GitLab Duo Agent Platform features at no extra cost. Usage above these included credits will be billed separately. These included promotional credits are available for a limited time after GA, and subject to change at GitLab’s discretion.4. How can I control and monitor credit usage?GitLab provides multiple governance tools: detailed usage dashboards in both the Customers Portal and in-product, the ability to enable/disable access for specific teams or projects, upcoming user-level controls, and automated email alerts at 50%, 80%, and 100% of committed monthly credits. We also expect to offer a sizing calculator to estimate your monthly credit needs.5. How do I get started with GitLab Duo Agent Platform?Once GA, for existing Premium/Ultimate customers, access is automatic on GitLab.com SaaS. Self-Managed customers gain access when upgrading to GitLab 18.8 with the planned Duo Agent Platform general availability. Simply enable GitLab Duo Agent Platform in your namespace settings and start exploring using your included monthly credits. For usage beyond included credits, you can opt-in to on-demand billing or contact GitLab for volume discounts with annual commitments.This blog post contains \"forward‑looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

It promotes consistency, reusability, and collaboration by enabling teams to leverage pre-built solutions and best practices.What you can do:Discover: Browse agents and flows created by GitLab and the community.Create: Create and maintain custom agents and flows in a single interface.Enable: Enable agents and flows at your top-level group level, then use them in your projects.Share: Publish your agents and flows for others to use (Public or Private).Duplicate: Copy and customize existing agents and flows.\n\nAI CatalogAccessing and working with the AI CatalogNavigate to Explore → AI Catalog.The catalog currently provides two types:Agents — Custom agents for on-demand, interactive, or context-specific tasks.Flows — Custom flows for repeatable, multi-step automations, orchestrating a team of agents.For detailed information, see the AI Catalog documentation.Discover agents and flowsThe AI Catalog makes it easy to find agents and flows that fit your needs:How to browse:Navigate to Explore → AI Catalog.Select either Agents or Flows tab.Browse the available agents or flows and inspect title, description and visibility status.Click on any agent or flow to view more details.Enabling agents and flows:Once you find an agent or flow you want to use:Click the agent or flow to view details.Click the Enable in group button to add the agent or flow to your top-level group.Enable it in your project to start using it.Creating, sharing, and managing visibilityCreate agents and flowsHere are step-by-step instructions for creating agents and flows.Create agents:Navigate to Explore → AI Catalog → Agents → New agent.Brainstorm and define a specific task or specialization for this agent, for example, a debugging and troubleshooting agent.Add a display name and description to allow others to identify the purpose and why they would want to use the agent, for example troubleshoot-debugger.Specify visibility and access. Select a private project and set visibility to private to start with experiments.Define the agent behavior, capabilities, and specialization in the system prompt. For details on crafting effective system prompts, see Part 3: Understanding agents.Optionally select and limit the tool access for agents. For example, a debugging agent needs read access to code, issues, and merge requests, but may not require write access to make changes.Create flows:Navigate to Explore → AI Catalog → Flows → New flow.Brainstorm and define a complex multi-step specific task, for example, a CI/CD pipeline optimizer flow.Add a display name and description to allow others to identify the purpose and why they would want to use the flow, for example ci-cd-optimizer.Specify visibility and access. Select a private project and set visibility to private to start with experiments.Define the flow behavior and its agent components, prompts, and routers. For details on flow YAML structure, see Part 4: Understanding flows.For more details, see:Custom Agents documentationCustom Flows documentationShare your work and set visibilityWhen creating agents or flows, you can choose between Private and Public visibility to control who can access and use them.Private:Can be viewed only by members of the managing project who have at least the Developer role, or by users with the Owner role for the top-level group.Cannot be enabled in other projects.Useful for team-specific or sensitive workflows.Public:Viewable by anyone on the instance.Can be enabled in any project that meets prerequisites.Appears in AI Catalog for discovery.Best practices for sharingWhen publishing agents and flows to the AI Catalog, follow these guidelines:Naming:Use clear, descriptive names (e.g., security-code-review, api-documentation-generator).Avoid generic names like agent1 or my-flow.Include the purpose in the name when possible.Documentation:Provide a clear description of what the agent or flow does.Include use cases and examples.Document any prerequisites or dependencies.Quality:Test thoroughly before publishing.Ensure the agent or flow solves a real problem.Keep it maintainable and well-documented.Consider edge cases and error handling.Visibility decisions:Start with Private to test with your team.Move to Public once validated and documented.Only publish if it provides value to others.Consider the audience and use cases.Understanding versioningCustom agents and flows in the AI Catalog maintain a version history to track changes.How versioning works:GitLab automatically creates a new version when you update an agent's system prompt or modify a flow's configuration.Versions use semantic versioning (e.g., 1.0.0, 1.1.0).GitLab manages semantic versioning automatically — updates always increment the minor version.Versions are immutable, ensuring consistent behavior.Version pinning:When you enable an agent or flow:In a group: GitLab pins it to the latest version.In a project: GitLab pins it to the same version as your top-level group.This means:Your projects use a fixed, stable version of the agent or flow.Updates in the AI Catalog don't automatically affect your configuration.You must opt-in to update to new versions — updates are never automatic.You maintain full control over when to adopt new versions.Viewing versions:Navigate to Automate → Agents or Automate → Flows.Select the agent or flow to view its version on the right side in the About section.Updating to the latest versionWhen a new version of an agent or flow is available in the AI Catalog, you can update your projects to use it.Navigate to Automate → Agents or Automate → Flows.Click the agent or flow you want to update.Click the Update button (appears when a newer version is available).Review the changes in the new version.Confirm the update to pin your project to the latest version.What's next?You now understand how to discover, create, and share agents and flows through the AI Catalog.

    "summary": "Welcome to Part 8 of our eight-part guide, Getting started with GitLab Duo Agent Platform, where you'll master building and deploying AI agents and workflows within your development lifecycle. Follow tutorials that take you from your first interaction to production-ready automation workflows with full customization.In this article:Introduction to customizationCustomize agent behaviorExtend capabilities with MCPCreate custom agents and flows🎯 Try GitLab Duo Agent Platform today!Introduction to customizationGitLab Duo Agent Platform delivers powerful capabilities right away, and you can unlock even greater value by tailoring it to your team's specific needs. GitLab offers flexible customization options across multiple levels:User-level: Personal preferences that apply across all projects (custom rules, AGENTS.md, MCP config)Workspace-level: Project-specific configurations (custom rules, AGENTS.md, MCP config)Project-level: Custom agents and flows you create and manage within a specific projectPart 1: Customize agent behaviorCustom rulesCustom rules provide instructions for agents and flows, ensuring consistent behavior across your team without requiring repetition. For example, in development style guides or how to execute tests.Navigate to IDE workspace or user configuration directory.User-level custom rulesUser-level rules apply to all your projects and workspaces.For detailed instructions on creating user-level custom rules, see the GitLab documentation.\nCreate the file ~/.gitlab/duo/chat-rules.md in your home directory.\nExample rules:- Include JSDoc comments for all functions\n- Use single quotes for strings\n- Follow the existing code style in the repository\n- Write concise explanations, avoid lengthy descriptions\n- Suggest tests for any code changes\n- Use async/await instead of promises\nWorkspace-level custom rulesWorkspace rules apply only to a specific project. They override user-level rules for that project.Create the file .gitlab/duo/chat-rules.md in your project root.Example rules for a Vue.js project:- Use Vue 3 Composition API with `<script setup>`\n- Always include TypeScript types for props\n- Use scoped styles with SCSS\n- Follow the Slippers UI design system\n- Keep components under 300 lines\n- Use kebab-case for component names\n- Include accessibility attributes (aria-*, role)\nBest practices for custom rulesBe specific: \"Use single quotes\" is better than \"follow style guide.\"Prioritize: List most important rules first.Team-focused: Rules should reflect your team's standards, not personal preferences.Actionable: Rules should be clear enough for an AI agent to follow.Maintainable: Update rules when your standards change.Avoid conflicts: Don't contradict your codebase's actual style.Tip: Use Code Owners to manage who approves changes to .gitlab/duo/chat-rules.md.For a detailed use case tutorial for custom rules, see the Custom rules in GitLab Duo Agentic Chat for greater developer efficiency deep-dive blog post.AGENTS.md for customizing agent behaviorAGENTS.md is an industry-standard file for customizing agent behavior. It allows you to define how agents should behave in your chat conversations, foundational flows, and custom flows without modifying the agents themselves.Difference to custom rules: AGENTS.md are consumed by all agents and flows (foundational and custom). It also follows an industry standard that other AI tools can use, for example, Claude Code as external agent. Use AGENTS.md when you want your instructions to apply across multiple contexts.User-level (applies to all your projects and workspaces):macOS/Linux: ~/.gitlab/duo/AGENTS.mdWindows: %APPDATA%\\GitLab\\duo\\AGENTS.mdWorkspace-level (applies to a specific project):Create AGENTS.md in your project root.Subdirectory-level (applies to specific directories in monorepos):Create AGENTS.md in subdirectories for context-specific instructions.How it works:User-level AGENTS.md applies globally across all projects.Workspace-level AGENTS.md applies to a specific project.Subdirectory-level AGENTS.md files provide context for specific parts of your codebase.Agents and flows combines instructions from all applicable levels.Newly added or updated AGENTS.md instructions require triggering new flows, or starting a new chat with a (custom) agent.What AGENTS.md controlsAgent personality and toneProject-specific instructionsCoding standards and conventionsTool usage preferencesOutput formatting requirementsRepository structure and organizationExample AGENTS.md# Agent Customization for Our Project\n## General Guidelines\n- Always prioritize code quality over speed\n- Follow our project's architecture patterns\n- Reference existing code examples when suggesting changes\n- Ask for clarification if requirements are ambiguous\n## Code Style\n- Use TypeScript for all new code\n- Follow ESLint configuration in the project\n- Include unit tests for all new functions\n- Use descriptive variable names (no single letters except loops)\n## Documentation\n- Add JSDoc comments to all public functions\n- Update README.md if adding new features\n- Include examples in code comments\n## Security\n- Never suggest hardcoding secrets or API keys\n- Always validate user input\n- Use parameterized queries for database operations\n- Flag potential security issues immediately\nBest practices for AGENTS.mdBe specific: Include concrete examples from your project.Keep it concise: Focus on what's unique to your project.Version control: Commit to your repository and track changes.Team alignment: Discuss with your team before finalizing.Update regularly: Refine as your project evolves.Document repository structure: Help agents understand your codebase organization.RequirementsGitLab 18.8 or laterFor VS Code: GitLab Workflow extension 6.60 or laterFor JetBrains: GitLab plugin 3.26.0 or laterFor flows: Update flow configuration to access the user_rule contextLearn more about AGENTS.md.Custom review instructionsCustom review instructions provide specific guidelines for the Code Review foundational flow. The instructions ensure consistent code review standards, and can be tailored to specific file types in your project.Create the file .gitlab/duo/mr-review-instructions.yaml in your project root.Example review instructions:instructions:\n  - name: Ruby Style Guide\n    fileFilters:\n      - \"*.rb\"           # Ruby files in the root directory\n      - \"lib/**/*.rb\"    # Ruby files in lib and its subdirectories\n      - \"!spec/**/*.rb\"  # Exclude test files\n    instructions: |\n      1. Ensure all methods have proper documentation\n      2. Follow Ruby style guide conventions\n      3. Prefer symbols over strings for hash keys\n\n  - name: TypeScript Source Files\n    fileFilters:\n      - \"**/*.ts\"        # TypeScript files in any directory\n      - \"!**/*.test.ts\"  # Exclude test files\n    instructions: |\n      1. Ensure proper TypeScript types (avoid 'any')\n      2. Follow naming conventions\n      3. Document complex functions\n\nBest practices for custom review instructions:Be specific and actionable: Clear, numbered instructions work best.Use glob patterns: Target specific file types with fileFilters.Focus on important standards: Prioritize the most critical review points.Explain the \"why\": Help reviewers understand the reasoning.Test patterns: Ensure glob patterns match the intended files.Tip: Use Code Owners to protect changes to .gitlab/duo/mr-review-instructions.yaml.For detailed setup instructions and examples, see the Custom Review Instructions documentation.Part 2: Extend capabilities with MCPModel Context Protocol (MCP) enables agents to access external systems like Jira, Slack, AWS, and more. This section covers MCP configuration for extending agent capabilities.🎯 Try it now: Interactive demo of MCP - Explore how to use Model Context Protocol.MCP configuration for external integrationsModel Context Protocol (MCP) enables agents to access external systems like Jira, Slack, AWS, and more.Scope: User-level (applies to all workspaces) or Workspace-level (project-specific, overrides user config)Create user configuration:macOS/Linux: ~/.gitlab/duo/mcp.jsonWindows: C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\GitLab\\duo\\mcp.jsonVS Code: Run command GitLab MCP: Open User Settings (JSON)Create workspace configuration:Create file: .gitlab/duo/mcp.json in your project rootBest practices:Security first: Use MCP servers that require OAuth and not plain-text password tokens.Minimal scope: Only enable MCP servers you actually use and trust.Test locally: Verify MCP connections and authorization work before sharing across teams.Document integrations: Explain what each MCP server provides.Version control: Store configuration in .gitlab/duo/mcp.json with Code Owners' approval.For detailed setup instructions and configuration examples, see Part 7: Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration.Part 3: Create custom agents and flowsCustom agents and flows allow you to automate your team's specific workflows. Before diving into customization, it's helpful to understand what they are and how they work. Here are parts of the Getting started with GitLab Duo Agent Platform guide that can help.Part 3: Understanding agents — Learn about foundational, custom, and external agents, and when to use each type.Part 4: Understanding flows — Discover how flows orchestrate multiple agents to solve complex problems.Part 5: AI Catalog — Learn how to discover, create, and share agents and flows across your organization.\nOnce you understand the basics, this section provides an overview of customization options with links to detailed guides.System prompts for custom agentsSystem prompts define an agent's personality, expertise, and behavior. A well-crafted prompt makes agents more effective and aligned with your team's needs.What are system prompts? System prompts are instructions that tell an agent how to behave, what expertise it has, and how to respond to requests. They're the foundation of custom agent behavior.Key elements of a strong system prompt:Role definition: What the agent is and what it doesExpertise areas: Specific domains or technologiesBehavior guidelines: How it should interact and respondOutput format: Structure of responsesConstraints: What it should avoidBest practices:Be detailed: More specific prompts produce better results.Use examples: Show the agent what good output looks like.Define scope: Clearly state what the agent should and shouldn't do.Test iteratively: Refine prompts based on agent behavior.Version control: Track prompt changes in your repository.For detailed guidance on crafting system prompts and creating custom agents, see Part 3: Understanding agents.Custom agents and flowsThere is a lot to learn, and for easier reading, the tutorials are split:Custom agents:Learn how to create agents with custom system prompts, configure tools, and manage permissions.See Part 3: Understanding agents - Custom agents section.Custom flows:Learn how to create multi-step workflows, configure components, and set up event-driven automation.See Part 4: Understanding flows — Custom flows section.Agent tools:Tools determine what actions agents can perform.

Unlike foundational flows that serve general purposes, custom flows are tailored to your organization's processes, tools, and requirements.Common use cases:Automated code review: Multi-stage review process (security scan → quality check → style validation)Compliance checking: Verify regulatory requirements, license compliance, or security policies on each MRDocumentation generation: Auto-update API docs, README files, or changelogs based on code changesDependency management: Weekly security scans, automated updates, and vulnerability reportsCustom testing: Specialized test suites for your tech stack or integration testsReal-world exampleA fintech company creates a compliance flow that runs on every merge request. When triggered by @compliance-flow, the flow executes the following steps:Security agent scans code for PCI-DSS violations and checks for exposed sensitive data.Code review agent verifies that changes follow secure coding standards and best practices.Documentation agent checks that API changes include updated documentation.Summary agent aggregates findings and posts a compliance report with pass/fail status.The entire compliance review happens automatically in 5-10 minutes, providing consistent checks across all merge requests.How to trigger custom flowsCustom flows can be triggered in multiple ways:1. Via mentions in Issues/MRs:\nMention the flow in a comment to trigger it. Example for a documentation generation flow:@doc-generator Generate API documentation for this feature\n2. By assigning the flow to an issue or MR:\nAssign the flow using either:GitLab UI: Click the \"Assign\" button on the issue/MR and select the flowCommand: Use the /assign command in a comment. Example:/assign @doc-generator\n3. By assigning the flow as a reviewer:\nAssign the flow as a reviewer on a merge request using either:GitLab UI: Click the \"Assign reviewer\" button on the merge request and select the flowCommand: Use the /assign_reviewer command in a comment. Example:/assign_reviewer @doc-reviewer\nAny of these methods automatically triggers the flow to execute and perform its tasks.How to create custom flowsCustom flows are created through the GitLab UI at Automate → Flows → New flow in your project, or from Explore → AI Catalog → Flows → New flow. You define your flow using YAML configuration that specifies components, prompts, routing, and execution flow. The YAML schema allows you to create sophisticated multi-agent workflows with precise control over agent behavior and orchestration.Key elements of a custom flow:Components: Define the agents and steps in your workflowPrompts: Configure AI model behavior and instructionsRouters: Control the flow between componentsToolsets: Specify which GitLab API tools agents can useExample custom flow YAMLBackground: This example shows a feature implementation flow for a travel booking platform. When a developer creates an issue with feature requirements, they can trigger this flow to automatically analyze the requirements, review the codebase, implement the solution, and create a merge request, all without manual intervention.\nHere's the YAML configuration:version: \"v1\"\nenvironment: ambient\ncomponents:\n  - name: \"implement_feature\"\n    type: AgentComponent\n    prompt_id: \"implementation_prompt\"\n    inputs:\n      - from: \"context:goal\"\n        as: \"user_goal\"\n      - from: \"context:project_id\"\n        as: \"project_id\"\n    toolset:\n      - \"get_issue\"\n      - \"get_repository_file\"\n      - \"list_repository_tree\"\n      - \"find_files\"\n      - \"blob_search\"\n      - \"create_file\"\n      - \"create_commit\"\n      - \"create_merge_request\"\n      - \"create_issue_note\"\n    ui_log_events:\n      - \"on_agent_final_answer\"\n      - \"on_tool_execution_success\"\n      - \"on_tool_execution_failed\"\n\nprompts:\n  - name: \"Cheapflights Feature Implementation\"\n    prompt_id: \"implementation_prompt\"\n    unit_primitives: []\n    prompt_template:\n      system: |\n        You are an expert full-stack developer specializing in travel booking platforms, specifically Cheapflights.\n\n        Your task is to:\n        1.

When triggered by an event (mention, assignment, or button click), a session is created and the flow starts to execute.Available environment variablesFlows have access to environment variables that provide context about the trigger and the GitLab object:AI_FLOW_CONTEXT — JSON-serialized context including MR diffs, issue descriptions, comments, and discussion threadsAI_FLOW_INPUT — The user's prompt or comment text that triggered the flowAI_FLOW_EVENT — The event type that triggered the flow (mention, assign, assign_reviewer)These variables allow your flow to understand what triggered it and access the relevant GitLab data to perform its task.Multi-agent flowsCustom flows can include multiple agent components that work together sequentially. The flow's YAML configuration defines:Components: One or more agents (AgentComponent) or deterministic stepsRouters: Define the flow between components (e.g., from component A to component B to end)Prompts: Configure each agent's behavior and modelFor example, a code review flow might have a security agent, then a quality agent, then an approval agent, with routers connecting them in sequence.Monitoring flow executionTo view flows that are running for your project:Navigate to Automate → Sessions.Select any session to view more details.The Details tab shows a link to the CI/CD job logs.Sessions show detailed information including step-by-step progress, tool invocations, reasoning, and decision-making process.When to use flowsComplex multi-step tasksBackground automationEvent-driven workflowsMulti-file changesTasks that take timeAutomated reviews/checksWhat's next?You now understand flows, how to create them, and when to use them vs. agents.
