I do not get the point of remote job if they are hiring from specific country.\nThe only thing I can do in nepal is public service commission (civil services) and crack computer engineer. But the pay is meagre there as well, unless I am lucky enough to enter central bank of Nepal(NRB).<p>Honestly, it feels like I am pushing not just a wall but universe itself in Nepal. Because nothing is going to happen irrespective of my abilities. I am currently preparing for PSC and I do not believe I will be happy as a PSC engineer even if I end up at NRB(central bank).<p>Something feels missing inside me. I have took countless therapies and what not. They helped me a lot to be where I am at now. I feel scared to try opportunities out of my comfort zone (kathmandu is my comfort zone).<p>As an adult, nobody pushes you, you have to push yourself. I am in a serious deadlock internally. I can decrease the effect using yoga and meditation but that does not troubleshoot the cause. Personally, I want to pursue something academic away from nepal.

I do not get the point of remote job if they are hiring from specific country.\nThe only thing I can do in nepal is public service commission (civil services) and crack computer engineer. But the pay is meagre there as well, unless I am lucky enough to enter central bank of Nepal(NRB).<p>Honestly, it feels like I am pushing not just a wall but universe itself in Nepal. Because nothing is going to happen irrespective of my abilities. I am currently preparing for PSC and I do not believe I will be happy as a PSC engineer even if I end up at NRB(central bank).<p>Something feels missing inside me. I have took countless therapies and what not. They helped me a lot to be where I am at now. I feel scared to try opportunities out of my comfort zone (kathmandu is my comfort zone).<p>As an adult, nobody pushes you, you have to push yourself. I am in a serious deadlock internally.

For organizations that require open, auditable models to address compliance or data sovereignty requirements, gpt-oss-120b provides a reliable alternative to proprietary models without sacrificing performance.</p>\n<p>For more information on supported models, please see our <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/gitlab_duo_self_hosted/supported_models_and_hardware_requirements/#supported-models\">documentation</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>End-user model selection for cloud-connected self-managed instances (GA)</strong></p>\n<p>Cloud-connected self-managed end users can now choose which AI model powers their GitLab Duo Agentic Chat experience directly from the GitLab UI. This gives administrators and end users more control over how conversations perform and how costs and governance requirements are managed.</p>\n<p>No matter the deployment environment \u2014 on-premises, private cloud, or public cloud \u2014  teams can select regionally compliant or in-house models to help satisfy data residency needs and compare model quality for speed or accuracy. This flexibility ensures that every organization can tailor Agentic Chat to its operational priorities.</p>\n<p>For full details on how to select a model in Agentic Chat, see the model selection section of the GitLab <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/gitlab_duo_chat/agentic_chat/#select-a-model\">documentation</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Web IDE support for air-gapped deployments</strong></p>\n<p>Air-gapped or tightly controlled environments \u2014 such as public sector organizations, defense agencies, and regulated enterprises \u2014 can now run the Web IDE with full functionality even without internet access. By allowing administrators to configure their own Web IDE extension host domain, GitLab enables markdown preview, code editing, and GitLab Duo Chat capabilities in isolated or offline systems. This makes it possible for development teams in secure or restricted networks to benefit from modern IDE workflows without sacrificing security and compliance.</p>\n<p><strong>Modern interface now default for self-managed instances</strong></p>\n<p>Self-managed GitLab instances now default to the modern interface in 18.6, bringing the same streamlined experience already available on GitLab.com to on-premises deployments. The updated layout improves navigation consistency and makes core workflows more intuitive across the platform. Administrators maintain full flexibility with opt-out controls via feature flag or user-level toggling if needed. This update ensures self-managed customers benefit from GitLab's latest interface improvements while maintaining the control and customization options enterprise environments require.</p>\n<h2>Platform security with awareness and authority</h2>\n<p>GitLab 18.6 strengthens platform security with deeper context and clearer control, helping security teams focus on the risks that matter most while maintaining governance across every project.</p>\n<p><strong>Security attributes and context filtering</strong></p>\n<p>Security teams can now apply custom business context labels to projects and groups, transforming raw scan results into prioritized, risk-based insights. Instead of viewing vulnerabilities in isolation, teams can tag projects by business unit, application type, or criticality \u2014 then filter and sort security data by impact. This allows organizations to focus remediation on the areas of greatest business risk, helping to accelerate time to resolution for the issues that matter most.</p>\n<h2>AI that adapts to your workflow</h2>\n<p>This release represents more than new capabilities \u2014 it's about how GitLab Duo Agent Platform is becoming an embedded part of everyday software development workflows.

    "title": "GitLab engineer: How I improved my onboarding experience with AI",
    "url": "https://about.gitlab.com/blog/gitlab-engineer-how-i-improved-my-onboarding-experience-with-ai/",
    "summary": "<p>Starting a new job is exciting, and overwhelming. New teammates, new tools, and, in GitLab\u2019s case, a lot of documentation. Six weeks ago, I joined GitLab\u2019s Growth team as a fullstack engineer. Anyone who has gone through <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/the-source/platform/how-to-accelerate-developer-onboarding-and-why-it-matters/\">onboarding at GitLab</a> knows it\u2019s transparent, extensive, and thorough.</p>\n<p>GitLab's onboarding process includes a lot of docs, videos, and trainings that will bring you up to speed. Also, in line with GitLab's values, my team encouraged me to start contributing right away. I quickly realized that onboarding here is both diligent and intense. Luckily, I had a secret helper: <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-duo/\">GitLab Duo</a>.</p>\n<h2>My main use cases</h2>\n<p>I\u2019ve found GitLab Duo's AI assistance, available throughout the software development lifecycle, useful in three key areas: exploration, reviewing, and debugging. With GitLab Duo, I was able to get my first tiny MR deployed to production in the first week and actively contribute to <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2025/10/16/gitlab-18-5-released/#pick-up-where-you-left-off-on-the-new-personal-homepage\">the personal homepage</a> in GitLab 18.5 in the weeks after.</p>\n<h3>Exploration</h3>\n<p>Early in onboarding, I often remembered reading something but couldn\u2019t recall where. GitLab has a <a href=\"https://handbook.gitlab.com/\">public-facing handbook</a>, an internal handbook, and <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/\">GitLab Docs</a>. It can be difficult to search across all of them efficiently.</p>\n<p>GitLab Duo simplifies this task: I can describe what I\u2019m looking for in natural language via <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/gitlab_duo_chat/\">GitLab Duo Chat</a> and search across all resources at once.</p>\n<p>Example prompt:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I remember reading about how RSpec tests are done at GitLab. Can you find relevant documentation across the Handbook, the internal handbook and the GitLab Docs?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Before starting work on an issue, I use GitLab Duo to identify edge cases and hidden dependencies. GitLab Duo will relate the requirements of the issue against the whole GitLab codebase, assess similar features, and prepare all the findings. Based on its output I am able to refine the issue with my product manager and designer, and make sure my implementation covers all edge cases or define future iterations.</p>\n<p>Example prompt:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Analyze this issue in the context of its epic and identify:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Implementation questions to ask PM/design before coding</li>\n<li>Edge cases not covered in requirements</li>\n<li>Cross-feature dependencies that might be affected</li>\n<li>Missing acceptance criteria</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I also check that my planned solution follows GitLab best practices and common patterns.</p>\n<p>Example prompt:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I want to implement XZY behavior \u2014 how is this usually done at GitLab, and what other options do I have?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Reviewing</h3>\n<p>I always <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/merge_requests/duo_in_merge_requests/#have-gitlab-duo-review-your-code\">let GitLab Duo review my merge requests</a> before assigning human reviewers. It often catches small mistakes, suggests improvements, and highlights edge cases I missed. This shortens the review cycle and helps my teammates focus on more complex and bigger-picture feedback.</p>\n<p>Since I\u2019m still new to GitLab\u2019s codebase and coding practices, some review comments are hard to interpret. In those cases, GitLab Duo helps me understand what a reviewer means and how it relates to my code.</p>\n<p>Example prompt:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I don\u2019t understand the comment on this MR about following the user instead of testing component internals, what does it mean and how does it relate to my implementation?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Debugging</h3>\n<p>Sometimes pipeline tests on my merge requests failed unexpectedly. If I can\u2019t tell whether my changes are the cause, GitLab Duo helps me investigate and fix the failures. Using <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/gitlab_duo_chat/agentic_chat/\">GitLab Duo Agentic Chat</a>, Duo can apply changes to debug the failing job.</p>\n<p>Example prompt:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The pipeline job \u201crspec system pg16 12/32\u201d is failing, but I don\u2019t know whether that relates to my changes. Can you check, if my changes are causing the pipeline failure and, if so, guide me through the steps of fixing it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>How Duo aligns with GitLab\u2019s values</h2>\n<p>Using GitLab Duo doesn\u2019t just help me, it also supports <a href=\"https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/\">GitLab\u2019s CREDIT values</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Collaboration:</strong> I ask teammates fewer basic questions. And when I do ask questions, they\u2019re more thoughtful and informed. This respects their time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Results for customers:</strong> By identifying edge cases early and improving code quality, GitLab Duo helps me deliver better outcomes for customers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Streamlined preparation, faster reviews, and improved debugging make me more efficient.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Diversity, inclusion &amp; belonging:</strong> AI guidance might mitigate misunderstandings and different barriers to entry based on differing backgrounds and abilities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Iteration:</strong> The ability to try ideas faster and identify potential improvements, enables faster iteration.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Transparency:</strong> GitLab Duo makes the already transparent documentation at GitLab more accessible.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Staying cautious with AI</h2>\n<p>It never has been as easy and difficult to be competent as in the days of AI. It can be a powerful tool, but AI does get things wrong. Therefore, I avoid <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00146-025-02422-7\">automation bias</a> by always validating AI's outputs. If I don\u2019t understand the output, I don\u2019t use it.\nI\u2019m also cautious of over-reliance. Studies suggest that heavy AI use can lead to <a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4698/15/1/6\">cognitive offloading</a> and worse outcomes in the long run. One study shows that users of AI <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19699?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">perform worse in exams</a>. To avoid negatively affecting my skills, I use AI as a discussion partner rather than just implementing the code it generates.</p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>Onboarding is always a stressful time, but using GitLab Duo made mine smoother and less overwhelming. I learned more about GitLab\u2019s codebase, culture, and best practices than I could have managed on my own.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Want to make GitLab Duo part of your onboarding experience?

    "url": "https://about.gitlab.com/blog/whats-new-in-git-2-52-0/",
    "summary": "<p>The Git project recently released <a href=\"https://lore.kernel.org/git/xmqqh5usmvsd.fsf@gitster.g/\">Git 2.52</a>. After a relatively short 8-week <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/what-s-new-in-git-2-51-0/\">release cycle for 2.51</a>, due to summer in the Northern Hemisphere, this release is back to the usual 12-week cycle. Let\u2019s look at some notable changes, including contributions from the GitLab Git team and the wider Git community.</p>\n<h2>New git-last-modified(1) command</h2>\n<p>Many Git forges like GitLab display files in a tree view like this:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Name</th>\n<th>Last commit</th>\n<th>Last update</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>README.md</td>\n<td>README: *.txt -&gt; *.adoc fixes</td>\n<td>4 months ago</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>RelNotes</td>\n<td>Start 2.51 cycle, the first batch</td>\n<td>4 weeks ago</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>SECURITY.md</td>\n<td>SECURITY: describe how to report vulnerabilities</td>\n<td>4 years</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>abspath.c</td>\n<td>abspath: move related functions to abspath</td>\n<td>2 years</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>abspath.h</td>\n<td>abspath: move related functions to abspath</td>\n<td>2 years</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>aclocal.m4</td>\n<td>configure: use AC_LANG_PROGRAM consistently</td>\n<td>15 years ago</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>add-patch.c</td>\n<td>pager: stop using <code>the_repository</code></td>\n<td>7 months ago</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>advice.c</td>\n<td>advice: allow disabling default branch name advice</td>\n<td>4 months ago</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>advice.h</td>\n<td>advice: allow disabling default branch name advice</td>\n<td>4 months ago</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>alias.h</td>\n<td>rebase -m: fix serialization of strategy options</td>\n<td>2 years</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>alloc.h</td>\n<td>git-compat-util: move alloc macros to git-compat-util.h</td>\n<td>2 years ago</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>apply.c</td>\n<td>apply: only write intents to add for new files</td>\n<td>8 days ago</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>archive.c</td>\n<td>Merge branch 'ps/parse-options-integers'</td>\n<td>3 months ago</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>archive.h</td>\n<td>archive.h: remove unnecessary include</td>\n<td>1 year</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>attr.h</td>\n<td>fuzz: port fuzz-parse-attr-line from OSS-Fuzz</td>\n<td>9 months ago</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>banned.h</td>\n<td>banned.h: mark <code>strtok()</code> and <code>strtok_r()</code> as banned</td>\n<td>2 years</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;</p>\n<p>Next to the files themselves, we also display which commit last modified each respective file. This information is easy to extract from Git by executing the following command:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\">\n$ git log --max-count=1 HEAD -- &lt;filename&gt;\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>While nice and simple, this has a significant catch: Git does not have a way to extract this information for each of these files in a single command. So to get the last commit for all the files in the tree, we'd need to run this command for each file separately. This results in a command pipeline similar to the following:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\">\n$ git ls-tree HEAD --name-only | xargs --max-args=1 git log --max-count=1 HEAD --\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>Naturally, this isn't very efficient:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We need to spin up a fresh Git command for each file.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Git has to step through history for each file separately.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a consequence, this whole operation is quite costly and generates significant load for GitLab.</p>\n<p>To overcome these issues, a new Git subcommand <code>git-last-modified(1)</code> has been introduced. This command returns the commit for each file of a given commit:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\">\n$ git last-modified HEAD\n\n\ne56f6dcd7b4c90192018e848d0810f091d092913        add-patch.c\n373ad8917beb99dc643b6e7f5c117a294384a57e        advice.h\ne9330ae4b820147c98e723399e9438c8bee60a80        advice.c\n5e2feb5ca692c5c4d39b11e1ffa056911dd7dfd3        alloc.h\n954d33a9757fcfab723a824116902f1eb16e05f7        RelNotes\n4ce0caa7cc27d50ee1bedf1dff03f13be4c54c1f        apply.c\n5d215a7b3eb0a9a69c0cb9aa43dcae956a0aa03e        archive.c\nc50fbb2dd225e7e82abba4380423ae105089f4d7        README.md\n72686d4e5e9a7236b9716368d86fae5bf1ae6156        attr.h\nc2c4138c07ca4d5ffc41ace0bfda0f189d3e262e        archive.h\n5d1344b4973c8ea4904005f3bb51a47334ebb370        abspath.c\n5d1344b4973c8ea4904005f3bb51a47334ebb370        abspath.h\n60ff56f50372c1498718938ef504e744fe011ffb        banned.h\n4960e5c7bdd399e791353bc6c551f09298746f61        alias.h\n2e99b1e383d2da56c81d7ab7dd849e9dab5b7bf0        SECURITY.md\n1e58dba142c673c59fbb9d10aeecf62217d4fc9c        aclocal.m4\n</code></pre>\n<p>The benefit of this is obviously that we only have to execute a single Git process now to derive all of that information. But even more importantly, it only requires us to walk the history once for all files together instead of having to walk it multiple times. This is achieved by:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Start walking the history from the specified commit.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For each commit:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If it doesn't modify any of the paths we're interested in we continue to the next commit.</li>\n<li>If it does, we print the commit ID together with the path. Furthermore, we remove the path from the set of interesting paths.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When the list of interesting paths becomes empty we stop.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Gitaly has already been adjusted to use the new command, but the logic is still guarded by a feature flag. Preliminary testing has shown that <code>git-last-modified(1)</code> is in most situations at least twice as fast compared to using <code>git log --max-count=1</code>.</p>\n<p><em>These changes were <a href=\"https://github.com/ttaylorr/git/tree/tb/blame-tree\">originally written</a> by multiple developers from GitHub and were <a href=\"https://lore.kernel.org/git/20250805093358.1791633-1-toon@iotcl.com/\">upstreamed</a> into Git by <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab.com/toon\">Toon Claes</a>.</em></p>\n<h2>git-fast-export(1) and git-fast-import(1) signature-related improvements</h2>\n<p>The <code>git-fast-export(1)</code> and <code>git-fast-import(1)</code> commands are designed to be mostly used by interoperability or history rewriting tools. The goal of interoperability tools is to make Git interact nicely with other software, usually a different version control system, that stores data in a different format than Git. For example <a href=\"https://github.com/frej/fast-export\">hg-fast-export.sh</a> is a \u201cMercurial to Git converter using git-fast-import.&quot;</p>\n<p>Alternately, history-rewriting tools let users \u2014 usually admins \u2014 make changes to the history of their repositories that are not possible or not allowed by the version control system. For example, <a href=\"http://www.catb.org/esr/reposurgeon/\">reposurgeon</a> says in its <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/esr/reposurgeon/-/blob/master/repository-editing.adoc?ref_type=heads#introduction\">introduction</a> that its purpose is \u201cto enable risky operations that version-control systems don't want to let you do, such as (a) editing past comments and metadata, (b) excising commits, (c) coalescing and splitting commits, (d) removing files and subtrees from repo history, (e) merging or grafting two or more repos, and (f) cutting a repo in two by cutting a parent-child link, preserving the branch structure of both child repos.&quot;</p>\n<p>Within GitLab, we use <a href=\"https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo\">git-filter-repo</a> to let admins perform some risky operations on their Git repositories. Unfortunately, until Git 2.50 (released last June), both <code>git-fast-export(1)</code> and <code>git-fast-import(1)</code> didn't handle cryptographic commit signatures at all. So, although <code>git-fast-export(1)</code> had a <code>--signed-tags=&lt;mode&gt;</code> option that allows users to change how cryptographic tag signatures are handled, commit signatures were simply ignored.</p>\n<p>Cryptographic signatures are very fragile because they are based on the exact commit or tag data that was signed. When the signed data or any of its preceding history changes, the cryptographic signature becomes invalid. This is a fragile but necessary requirement to make these signatures useful.</p>\n<p>But in the context of rewriting history this is a problem:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We may want to keep cryptographic signatures for both commits and tags that are still valid after the rewrite (e.g. because the history leading up to them did not change).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We may want to create new cryptographic signatures for commits and tags where the previous signature has become invalid.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Neither <code>git-fast-import(1)</code> nor <code>git-fast-export(1)</code> allow for these use cases though, which limits what tools like <a href=\"https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo\">git-filter-repo</a> or <a href=\"http://www.catb.org/esr/reposurgeon/\">reposurgeon</a> can achieve.</p>\n<p>We have made some significant progress:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>In Git 2.50 we added a <code>--signed-commits=&lt;mode&gt;</code> option to <code>git-fast-export(1)</code> for exporting commit signatures, and support in <code>git-fast-import(1)</code> for importing them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In Git 2.51 we improved the format used for exporting and importing commit signatures, and we made it possible for <code>git-fast-import(1)</code> to import both a signature made on the SHA-1 object ID of the commit and one made on its SHA-256 object ID.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In Git 2.52 we added the <code>--signed-commits=&lt;mode&gt;</code> and <code>--signed-tags=&lt;mode&gt;</code> options to <code>git-fast-import(1)</code>, so the user has control over how to handle signed data at import time.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is still more to be done. We need to add the ability to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Retain only those commit signatures that are still valid to <code>git-fast-import(1)</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Re-sign data where the signature became invalid.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We have already started to work on these next steps and expect this to land in Git 2.53. Once done, tools like <code>git-filter-repo(1)</code> will finally start to handle cryptographic signatures more gracefully. We will keep you posted in our next Git release blog post.</p>\n<p><em>This project was led by <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/chriscool\">Christian Couder</a>.</em></p>\n<h2>New and improved git-maintenance(1) strategies</h2>\n<p>Git repositories require regular maintenance to ensure that they perform well. This maintenance performs a bunch of different tasks: references get optimized, objects get compressed, and stale data gets pruned.</p>\n<p>Until Git 2.28, these maintenance tasks were performed by <code>git-gc(1)</code>. The problem with this command is that it wasn't built with customizability in mind: While certain parameters can be configured, it is not possible to control which parts of a repository should be optimized. This means that it may not be a good fit for all use cases. Even more importantly, it made it very hard to iterate on how exactly Git performs repository maintenance.</p>\n<p>To fix this issue and allow us to iterate again, <a href=\"https://github.com/derrickstolee\">Derrick Stolee</a> introduced <code>git-maintenance(1)</code>. In contrast to <code>git-gc(1),</code> it is built with customizability in mind and allows the user to configure which tasks specifically should be running in a certain repository. This new tool was made the default for Git\u2019s automated maintenance in Git 2.29, but, by default, it still uses <code>git-gc(1)</code> to perform the maintenance.</p>\n<p>While this default maintenance strategy works well in small or even medium-sized repositories, it is problematic in the context of large monorepos. The biggest limiting factor is how <code>git-gc(1)</code> repacks objects: Whenever there are more than 50 packfiles, the tool will merge all of them together into a single packfile. This operation is quite CPU-intensive and causes a lot of I/O operations, so for large monorepos this operation can easily take many minutes or even hours to complete.</p>\n<p>Git already knows how to minimize these repacks via \u201cgeometric repacking.\u201d The idea is simple: The packfiles that exist in the repository must follow a geometric progression where every packfile must contain at least twice as many objects as the next smaller one. This allows Git to amortize the number of repacks required while still ensuring that there is only a relatively small number of packfiles overall. This mode was introduced by <a href=\"https://github.com/ttaylorr\">Taylor Blau</a> in Git 2.32, but it was not wired up as part of the automated maintenance.</p>\n<p>All the parts exist to make repository maintenance way more scalable for large monorepos: We have the flexible <code>git-maintenance(1)</code> tool that can be extended to have a new maintenance strategy, and we have a better way to repack objects. All that needs to be done is to combine these two.</p>\n<p>And that's exactly what we did with Git 2.52! We have introduced a new \u201cgeometric\u201d maintenance strategy that you can configure in your Git repositories. This strategy is intended as a full replacement for the old strategy based on <code>git-gc(1)</code>. Here is the config code you need:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\">\n$ git config set maintenance.strategy geometric\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>From hereon, Git will use geometric repacking to optimize your objects. This should lead to less churn while ensuring that your objects are in a better-optimized state, especially in large monorepos.</p>\n<p>In Git 2.53, we aim to make this the default strategy. So stay tuned!</p>\n<p><em>This project was led by <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/pks-gitlab\">Patrick Steinhardt</a>.</em></p>\n<h2>New subcommand for git-repo(1) to display repository metrics</h2>\n<p>Performance of Git operations in a repository are often dependent on certain characteristics of its underlying structure. At GitLab, we host some extremely large repositories and having insight into the general structure of a repository is critical to understand performance. While it is possible to compose various Git commands and other tools together to surface certain repository metrics, Git lacks a means to surface info about a repository's shape/structure via a single command. This has led to the development of other external tools, such as <a href=\"https://github.com/github/git-sizer\">git-sizer(1)</a>, to fill this gap.</p>\n<p>With the release of Git 2.52, a new \u201cstructure\u201d subcommand has been added to git-repo(1) with the aim to surface information about a repository's structure. Currently, it displays info about the number of references and objects in the repository in the following form:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\">\n$ git repo structure\n\n\n| Repository structure | Value  |\n| -------------------- | ------ |\n| * References         |        |\n|   * Count            |   1772 |\n|     * Branches       |      3 |\n|     * Tags           |   1025 |\n|     * Remotes        |    744 |\n|     * Others         |      0 |\n|                      |        |\n| * Reachable objects  |        |\n|   * Count            | 418958 |\n|     * Commits        |  87468 |\n|     * Trees          | 168866 |\n|     * Blobs          | 161632 |\n|     * Tags           |    992 |\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>In subsequent releases we hope to expand on this and provide other interesting data points like the largest objects in the repository.</p>\n<p><em>This project was led by <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/justintobler\">Justin Tobler</a>.</em></p>\n<h2>Improvements related to the Google Summer of Code 2025</h2>\n<p>We had three successful projects with the Google Summer of Code.</p>\n<h3>Refactoring in order to reduce Git's global state</h3>\n<p>Git contains several global variables used throughout the codebase. This increases the complexity of the code and reduces the maintainability. As part of this project, <a href=\"https://ayu-ch.github.io/\">Ayush Chandekar</a> worked on reducing the usage of the <code>the_repository</code> global variable via a series of patches.</p>\n<p><em>The project was mentored by <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/chriscool\">Christian Couder</a> and <a href=\"https://in.linkedin.com/in/ghanshyam-thakkar\">Ghanshyam Thakkar</a>.</em></p>\n<h3>Machine-readable Repository Information Query Tool</h3>\n<p>Git lacks a centralized way to retrieve repository information, requiring users to piece it together from various commands. While <code>git-rev-parse(1)</code> has become the de-facto tool for accessing much of this information, doing so falls outside its primary purpose.</p>\n<p>As part of this project, <a href=\"https://lucasoshiro.github.io/en/\">Lucas Oshiro</a> introduced a new command, <code>git-repo(1),</code> which will house all repository-level information. Users can now use <code>git repo info</code> to obtain repository information:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\">\n$ git repo info layout.bare layout.shallow object.format references.format\n\nlayout.bare=false\nlayout.shallow=false\nobject.format=sha1\nreferences.format=reftable\n\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>The project was mentored by <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/pks-gitlab\">Patrick Steinhardt</a> and <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/knayakgl\">Karthik Nayak</a>.</em></p>\n<h3>Consolidate ref-related functionality into git-refs</h3>\n<p>Git offers multiple commands for managing references, namely <code>git-for-each-ref(1)</code>, <code>git show-ref(1)</code>, <code>git-update-ref(1)</code>, and <code>git-pack-refs(1)</code>. This makes them harder to discover and creates overlapping functionality. To address this, we introduced the <code>git-refs(1)</code> command to consolidate these operations under a single interface. As part of this this project, <a href=\"https://inosmeet.github.io/\">Meet Soni</a> extended the command by adding the following subcommands:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><code>git refs optimize</code> to optimize the reference backend</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>git refs list</code> to list all references</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>git refs exists</code> to verify the existence of a reference</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>The project was mentored by <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/pks-gitlab\">Patrick Steinhardt</a> and <a href=\"https://luolibrary.com/\">shejialuo</a>.</em></p>\n<h2>What's next?</h2>\n<p>Ready to experience these improvements? Update to Git 2.52.0 and start using <code>git last-modified</code>.</p>\n<p>At GitLab, we will of course ensure that all of these improvements will eventually land in a GitLab instance near you!</p>\n<p>Learn more in the <a href=\"https://lore.kernel.org/git/xmqqh5usmvsd.fsf@gitster.g/\">official Git 2.52.0 release notes</a> and explore our <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/tags/git/\">complete archive of Git development coverage</a>.</p>",

    "summary": "<p>For Defense Industrial Base (DIB) companies, the U.S. Department of Defense's release of the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/09/10/2025-17359/defense-federal-acquisition-regulation-supplement-assessing-contractor-implementation-of_\">Final Rule</a> and new guidance on \u201cFedRAMP equivalency\u201d has dramatically increased the cost of compliance and fundamentally changed the way in which they drive their risk management programs. Gone is the era of \u201cself-attestation\u201d of security programs; DIB companies are required to strictly apply NIST 800-171 to their environments that handle Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI), and have their security controls audited by a Third-Party Assessment Organization (3PAO) every three years.</p>\n<p>DIB companies are engineering focused, not compliance driven, and formal audits get pricey quickly. These changes add significant complications for companies focused on supporting the warfighter. The good news? <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/press/releases/2025-05-19-gitlab-announces-gitlab-achieves-fedramp-moderate-authorization/\">GitLab Dedicated for Government's FedRAMP Moderate Authorization</a> means DIB companies can directly use GitLab Dedicated for Government with no additional audits or authorizations, which reduces the impact and cost of compliance.</p>\n<h2>The foundational rule: FedRAMP Moderate Equivalency</h2>\n<p>The protection of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) within the DIB is driven by a foundational legal and contractual mandate: the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) <a href=\"https://www.acquisition.gov/dfars/252.204-7012-safeguarding-covered-defense-information-and-cyber-incident-reporting.\">Clause 252.204-7012</a>. This clause specifically states that if a contractor uses an external cloud service provider to &quot;store, process, or transmit any covered defense information,&quot; that provider must meet security requirements &quot;equivalent to those established by the Government for the FedRAMP Moderate baseline.&quot;</p>\n<p>The DOD's January 2, 2024, memorandum, &quot;<a href=\"https://dodcio.defense.gov/Portals/0/Documents/Library/FEDRAMP-EquivalencyCloudServiceProviders.pdf\">Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) Moderate Equivalency for Cloud Service Provider's (CSPs) Cloud Service Offerings</a>&quot; defines \u201cFedRAMP Moderate Equivalency,\u201d and also directly specifies that FedRAMP Moderate Cloud Service Offerings (CSOs) can be used without any additional assessment, such as individual CMMC assessment, to meet equivalency requirements:</p>\n<p>\u201cThis memorandum does not apply to CSOs that are FedRAMP Moderate Authorized under the existing FedRAMP process. <strong>FedRAMP Moderate Authorized CSOs identified in the FedRAMP Marketplace</strong> provide the required security to store, process or transmit CDI in accordance with Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations Supplement (DFARS) Clause 252.204-7012, &quot;Safeguarding Covered Defense Information and Cyber Incident Reporting&quot; and <strong>can be leveraged without further assessment to meet the equivalency requirements</strong>.\u201d</p>\n<h2>The GitLab platform: A proven path to compliance</h2>\n<p>GitLab's GovCloud Offering, GitLab Dedicated for Government, <a href=\"https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/products/FR2411959145\">has achieved FedRAMP Moderate Authorization</a>. This means that DIB companies can leverage GitLab Dedicated for Government as their DevSecOps platform immediately and without any additional audits or compliance checks. DIB companies leveraging GitLab Dedicated for Government inherit all of our security controls and our Body of Evidence, shifting the risk and cost of compliance away from themselves and allowing them to focus on their mission.</p>\n<h2>The Shared Responsibility Matrix: Your role as a DIB contractor</h2>\n<p>While a FedRAMP-authorized solution significantly reduces your compliance burden, compliance is a joint effort. You are responsible for the security controls that fall under your purview. This is where the Shared Responsibility Matrix (SRM), also called the Customer Responsibility Matrix (CRM), comes in.</p>\n<p>When you adopt GitLab Dedicated for Government, you will receive a comprehensive SRM that clearly delineates which security controls are managed by GitLab and which are your responsibility as the customer. Your CMMC C3PAO will use this document to ensure you have implemented the necessary controls on your end. By leveraging GitLab's FedRAMP-authorized platform, you can confidently address your CMMC Level 2 compliance requirements, focusing on your mission while trusting that GitLab has you covered.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To learn more about GitLab Dedicated for Government, visit our <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/public-sector/\">GitLab for Public Sector</a> page.

    "summary": "<p>Building <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-duo/agent-platform/\">AI agents</a> is</p>\n<p>exciting, but deploying them securely to production shouldn't be</p>\n<p>complicated. In this tutorial, you will learn how GitLab's <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/partners/understand-the-google-cloud-gitlab-integration\">native Google Cloud integration</a> makes it straightforward to deploy AI agents to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) \u2014 with built-in scanning and zero service account keys.</p>\n<h2>Why choose GKE to deploy your AI agents?</h2>\n<p>GKE provides enterprise-grade orchestration that connects seamlessly with GitLab CI/CD pipelines through OIDC authentication. Your development team can deploy AI agents while maintaining complete visibility, compliance, and control over your cloud infrastructure. This guide uses Google's Agent Development Kit (<a href=\"https://developers.googleblog.com/en/agent-development-kit-easy-to-build-multi-agent-applications/\">ADK</a>) to build the app, so you can expect increased seamlessness as this is deployed using GitLab.</p>\n<p>Three key advantages to this approach:</p>\n<p><strong>Full infrastructure control</strong> - Your data, your rules, your environment. You maintain complete control over where your AI agents run and how they're configured.</p>\n<p><strong>Native GitLab integration</strong> - No complex workarounds. Your existing pipelines work right out of the box thanks to GitLab's native integration with Google Cloud.</p>\n<p><strong>Production-grade scaling</strong> - GKE automatically handles the heavy lifting of scaling and internal orchestration as your AI workloads grow.</p>\n<p>The key point is that GitLab with GKE provides the enterprise reliability your AI deployments demand without sacrificing the developer experience your teams expect.</p>\n<h2>Prerequisites</h2>\n<p>Before you start, make sure you have these APIs enabled:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>GKE API</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Artifact Registry API</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Vertex AI API</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also make sure you have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>GitLab project created</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>GKE cluster provisioned</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Artifact Registry repository created</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The deployment process</h2>\n<h3>1. Set up IAM and permissions on GitLab</h3>\n<p>Navigate to your GitLab integrations to configure Google Cloud authentication (IAM).</p>\n<p>Go to <strong>Settings &gt; Integrations</strong> and configure the Google Cloud integration. If you're using a group-level integration, notice that default settings are already inherited by projects. This means you configure once at the group level, and all projects benefit and inherit this setting.</p>\n<p>To set this up from scratch, provide:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Project ID</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Project Number</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Workload Identity Pool ID</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Provider ID</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once configured, GitLab provides a script to run in Google Cloud Console, via Cloud Shell. The outcome of running this script is a Workload Identity Federation pool with the necessary service principal to enable the proper access.</p>\n<h3>2. Configure Artifact Registry integration</h3>\n<p>Still in GitLab's integration settings, configure Artifact Management:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Click <strong>Artifact Management</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select <strong>Google Artifact Registry</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Provide:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Project ID</li>\n<li>Repository Name (created beforehand)</li>\n<li>Repository Location</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>GitLab provides another script to run in Google Cloud Console.</p>\n<p><strong>Important:</strong> Before proceeding, add these extra roles to the Workload Identity Federation pool:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Service Account User</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Kubernetes Developer</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Kubernetes Cluster Viewer</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These permissions allow GitLab to deploy to GKE in subsequent steps.</p>\n<h3>3. Create the CI/CD pipeline</h3>\n<p>Now for the key part \u2014 creating the CI/CD pipeline for deployment.</p>\n<p>Head to <strong>Build &gt; Pipeline Editor</strong> and define your pipeline with four stages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Build</strong> - Docker creates the container image.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Test</strong> - GitLab Auto DevOps provides built-in security scans to ensure there are no vulnerabilities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Upload</strong> - Uses GitLab's built-in CI/CD component to push to Google Artifact Registry.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Deploy</strong> - Uses Kubernetes configuration to deploy to GKE.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here's the complete <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">\n\ndefault:\n  tags: [ saas-linux-2xlarge-amd64 ]\n\nstages:\n  - build\n  - test\n  - upload\n  - deploy\n\nvariables:\n  GITLAB_IMAGE: $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE/main:$CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA\n  AR_IMAGE: $GOOGLE_ARTIFACT_REGISTRY_REPOSITORY_LOCATION-docker.pkg.dev/$GOOGLE_ARTIFACT_REGISTRY_PROJECT_ID/$GOOGLE_ARTIFACT_REGISTRY_REPOSITORY_NAME/main:$CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA\n  GCP_PROJECT_ID: &quot;your-project-id&quot;\n  GKE_CLUSTER: &quot;your-cluster&quot;\n  GKE_REGION: &quot;us-central1&quot;\n  KSA_NAME: &quot;ai-agent-ksa&quot;\n\nbuild:\n  image: docker:24.0.5\n  stage: build\n  services:\n    - docker:24.0.5-dind\n  before_script:\n    - docker login -u $CI_REGISTRY_USER -p $CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD $CI_REGISTRY\n  script:\n    - docker build -t $GITLAB_IMAGE .\n    - docker push $GITLAB_IMAGE\n\ninclude:\n  - template: Jobs/Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml\n  - template: Jobs/Container-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml\n  - template: Jobs/Secret-Detection.gitlab-ci.yml\n  - component: gitlab.com/google-gitlab-components/artifact-registry/upload-artifact-registry@main\n    inputs:\n      stage: upload\n      source: $GITLAB_IMAGE\n      target: $AR_IMAGE\n\ndeploy:\n  stage: deploy\n  image: google/cloud-sdk:slim\n  identity: google_cloud\n  before_script:\n    - apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install -y kubectl google-cloud-sdk-gke-gcloud-auth-plugin\n    - gcloud container clusters get-credentials $GKE_CLUSTER --region $GKE_REGION --project $GCP_PROJECT_ID\n  script:\n    - |\n      kubectl apply -f - &lt;&lt;EOF\n      apiVersion: apps/v1\n      kind: Deployment\n      metadata:\n        name: ai-agent\n        namespace: default\n      spec:\n        replicas: 2\n        selector:\n          matchLabels:\n            app: ai-agent\n        template:\n          metadata:\n            labels:\n              app: ai-agent\n          spec:\n            serviceAccountName: $KSA_NAME\n            containers:\n            - name: ai-agent\n              image: $AR_IMAGE\n              ports:\n              - containerPort: 8080\n              resources:\n                requests: {cpu: 500m, memory: 1Gi}\n                limits: {cpu: 2000m, memory: 4Gi}\n              livenessProbe:\n                httpGet: {path: /health, port: 8080}\n                initialDelaySeconds: 60\n              readinessProbe:\n                httpGet: {path: /health, port: 8080}\n                initialDelaySeconds: 30\n      ---\n      apiVersion: v1\n      kind: Service\n      metadata:\n        name: ai-agent-service\n        namespace: default\n      spec:\n        type: LoadBalancer\n        ports:\n        - port: 80\n          targetPort: 8080\n        selector:\n          app: ai-agent\n      ---\n      apiVersion: autoscaling/v2\n      kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler\n      metadata:\n        name: ai-agent-hpa\n        namespace: default\n      spec:\n        scaleTargetRef:\n          apiVersion: apps/v1\n          kind: Deployment\n          name: ai-agent\n        minReplicas: 2\n        maxReplicas: 10\n        metrics:\n        - type: Resource\n          resource:\n            name: cpu\n            target: {type: Utilization, averageUtilization: 70}\n      EOF\n      \n      kubectl rollout status deployment/ai-agent -n default --timeout=5m\n      EXTERNAL_IP=$(kubectl get service ai-agent-service -n default -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')\n      echo &quot;Deployed at: http://$EXTERNAL_IP&quot;\n  only:\n    - main\n</code></pre>\n<h4>The critical configuration for GKE</h4>\n<p>What makes this work \u2014 and why we need this extra configuration for GKE\u2014 is that we must have a Kubernetes Service Account in the cluster that can work with Vertex AI. We need that service account to be permitted to access the AI capabilities of Google Cloud.</p>\n<p>Without this, we can deploy the application, but the AI agent won't work. We need to create a Kubernetes Service Account that can access Vertex AI.</p>\n<p>Run this one-time setup:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\n\nPROJECT_ID=&quot;your-project-id&quot;\n\n\nGSA_NAME=&quot;ai-agent-vertex&quot;\n\n\nGSA_EMAIL=&quot;${GSA_NAME}@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com&quot;\n\n\nKSA_NAME=&quot;ai-agent-ksa&quot;\n\n\nCLUSTER_NAME=&quot;your-cluster&quot;\n\n\nREGION=&quot;us-central1&quot;\n\n\n\n# Create GCP Service Account\n\n\ngcloud iam service-accounts create $GSA_NAME \\\n    --display-name=&quot;AI Agent Vertex AI&quot; \\\n    --project=$PROJECT_ID\n\n# Grant Vertex AI permissions\n\n\ngcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID \\\n    --member=&quot;serviceAccount:${GSA_EMAIL}&quot; \\\n    --role=&quot;roles/aiplatform.user&quot;\n\n# Get cluster credentials\n\n\ngcloud container clusters get-credentials $CLUSTER_NAME \\\n    --region $REGION --project $PROJECT_ID\n\n# Create Kubernetes Service Account\n\n\nkubectl create serviceaccount $KSA_NAME -n default\n\n\n\n# Link accounts\n\n\nkubectl annotate serviceaccount $KSA_NAME -n default \\\n    iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account=${GSA_EMAIL}\n\ngcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding ${GSA_EMAIL} \\\n    --role=roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser \\\n    --member=&quot;serviceAccount:${PROJECT_ID}.svc.id.goog[default/${KSA_NAME}]&quot; \\\n    --project=$PROJECT_ID\n</code></pre>\n<h3>4. Deploy to GKE</h3>\n<p>Once you're done, push this change to the pipeline and you're good to go.</p>\n<p>You can see the pipeline has just deployed.

    "summary": "<p><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/variables/#use-pipeline-variables\">Pipeline\nvariables</a>\nhave long been a convenient way to customize GitLab CI/CD pipelines at\nruntime. However, as CI/CD security best practices have evolved, we've\nrecognized the need for stronger controls around pipeline customization.\nUnrestricted pipeline variables allow any users with pipeline trigger\npermissions to override values without validation or type checking.</p>\n<p>Beyond security considerations, pipeline variables lack proper documentation and explicit declaration, making it difficult to understand what inputs are expected and how they're used throughout your pipeline. This can lead to maintenance challenges and make it harder to establish proper governance over your <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/topics/ci-cd/\">CI/CD</a> processes.</p>\n<h2>Enter pipeline inputs</h2>\n<p>Instead of relying on pipeline variables, we strongly recommend using GitLab's <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/inputs/#for-a-pipeline\">pipeline inputs</a> feature. Pipeline inputs provide:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Explicit declaration</strong>: Inputs must be explicitly declared in your <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> and are self-documented.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Type safety</strong>: Support for different input types (string, boolean, number, array)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Built-in validation</strong>: Automatic validation of input values</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Better security</strong>: No risk of variable injection attacks \u2014 only the declared inputs can be passed from the outside</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Basic example</h3>\n<pre><code>\nspec:\n  inputs:\n    deployment_env:\n      description: &quot;Target deployment environment&quot;\n      type: string\n      options: [&quot;staging&quot;, &quot;production&quot;]\n      default: &quot;staging&quot;\n    enable_tests:\n      description: &quot;Run test suite&quot;\n      type: boolean\n      default: true\n\ntest:\n  script:\n    - echo &quot;Running tests&quot;\n  rules:\n    - if: $[[ inputs.enable_tests ]] == true\n\ndeploy:\n  script:\n    - echo &quot;Deploying to $[[ inputs.deployment_env ]]&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Learn more about how CI/CD inputs provide type-safe parameter passing with validation in this <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/ci-cd-inputs-secure-and-preferred-method-to-pass-parameters-to-a-pipeline/\">tutorial</a>.</p>\n<h2>Restrict pipeline variables</h2>\n<p>To effectively move to pipeline inputs and away from pipeline variables, you should configure the <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/variables/#restrict-pipeline-variables\">&quot;Minimum role to use pipeline variables&quot;</a> setting. This setting provides fine-grained control over which role can use pipeline variables when triggering pipelines.</p>\n<p><strong>At the project level:</strong> Navigate to your project's <strong>Settings &gt; CI/CD &gt; Variables &gt; Minimum role to use pipeline variables</strong> to configure the setting.</p>\n<p>Available options are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>No one allowed</strong> (<code>no_one_allowed</code>) - Recommended and most secure option. Prevents all variable overrides.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Developer</strong> (<code>developer</code>) - Allows developers and above to override variables</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Maintainer</strong> (<code>maintainer</code>) - Requires maintainer role or higher</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Owner</strong> (<code>owner</code>) - Only project owners can override variables</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>At the group level:</strong> Group maintainers can go to <strong>Settings &gt; CI/CD &gt; Variables &gt; Default role to use pipeline variables</strong> to establish secure defaults for all new projects within their group, ensuring consistent security policies across your organization. Here we recommend again to use <strong>No one allowed</strong> as default value \u2014 this way, new projects in this group are created with a secure default setting. Note that this still allows project owners to change the setting.</p>\n<p>When pipeline variables are restricted completely (with \u201cNo one allowed\u201d), the <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/pipelines/#prefill-variables-in-manual-pipelines\">prefilled variables</a> won\u2019t appear in the &quot;New Pipeline UI&quot; form.</p>\n<h2>How to migrate from pipeline variables</h2>\n<h3>Close the gaps</h3>\n<p>Your group may have projects that have pipeline variables enabled by default despite never having used them when triggering a pipeline. These projects can be migrated to the more secure setting without a risk of interruption. GitLab <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/variables/#enable-pipeline-variable-restriction-for-multiple-projects\">provides migration functionality</a> via group settings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Go to <strong>Settings &gt; CI/CD &gt; Variables</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In <strong>Disable pipeline variables in projects that don\u2019t use them,</strong> select <strong>Start migration</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This migration is a background job that safely disables pipeline variables via project settings for all projects that historically have not used them.</p>\n<h3>Convert pipeline variables to inputs</h3>\n<p>For each identified pipeline variable, create a corresponding pipeline input.</p>\n<p><strong>Before (using pipeline variables)</strong></p>\n<pre><code>\nvariables:\n  DEPLOY_ENV:\n    description: &quot;Deployment environment&quot;\n    value: &quot;staging&quot;\n  ENABLE_CACHE:\n    description: &quot;Enable deployment cache&quot;\n    value: &quot;true&quot;\n  VERSION:\n    description: &quot;Application version&quot;\n    value: &quot;1.0.0&quot;\n\ndeploy:\n  script:\n    - echo &quot;Deploying version $VERSION to $DEPLOY_ENV&quot;\n    - |\n      if [ &quot;$ENABLE_CACHE&quot; = &quot;true&quot; ]; then\n        echo &quot;Cache enabled&quot;\n      fi\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>After (using pipeline inputs)</strong></p>\n<pre><code>\nspec:\n  inputs:\n    deploy_env:\n      description: &quot;Deployment environment&quot;\n      type: string\n      default: &quot;staging&quot;\n      options: [&quot;dev&quot;, &quot;staging&quot;, &quot;production&quot;]\n\n    enable_cache:\n      description: &quot;Enable deployment cache&quot;\n      type: boolean\n      default: true\n    \n    version:\n      description: &quot;Application version&quot;\n      type: string\n      default: &quot;1.0.0&quot;\n      regex: '^[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+$'\n\ndeploy:\n  script:\n    - echo &quot;Deploying version $[[ inputs.version ]] to $[[ inputs.deploy_env ]]&quot;\n    - |\n      if [ &quot;$[[ inputs.enable_cache ]]&quot; = &quot;true&quot; ]; then\n        echo &quot;Cache enabled&quot;\n      fi\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Migrate trigger jobs</h3>\n<p>If you use trigger jobs with the <code>trigger</code> keyword, ensure they don't define job-level <code>variables</code> or disable inheriting variables from top-level <code>variables</code>, <code>extends</code>, or <code>include</code>, because variables could implicitly be passed downstream as pipeline variables. If pipeline variables are restricted on the downstream project, pipeline creation will fail.</p>\n<p>Consider updating your CI configuration to use pipeline inputs instead of pipeline variables.</p>\n<pre><code>\nvariables:\n  FOO: bar\n\ndeploy-staging:\n  inherit:\n    variables: false # otherwise FOO would be sent downstream as a pipeline variable\n  trigger:\n    project: myorg/deployer\n    inputs:\n      deployment_env: staging\n      enable_tests: true\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>Migrating from pipeline variables to pipeline inputs is a security enhancement that protects your CI/CD infrastructure from variable injection while providing better documentation, type safety, and validation. By implementing these restrictions and adopting pipeline inputs, you're not just improving security, you're also making your pipelines more maintainable, self-documenting, and resilient.</p>\n<p>The transition requires some initial effort, but the long-term benefits far outweigh the migration costs. Start by restricting pipeline variables at the group level for new projects, then systematically migrate existing pipelines using the step-by-step approach outlined above.</p>\n<p>Security is not a destination but a journey. Pipeline inputs are one important step in creating a more secure CI/CD environment, complementing other GitLab security features like protected branches, job token allowlists, and container registry protections.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To get started with pipeline inputs, <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/free-trial/devsecops/\">sign up for a free trial of GitLab Ultimate today</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>",

    "url": "https://about.gitlab.com/blog/modernize-java-applications-quickly-with-gitlab-duo-with-amazon-q/",
    "summary": "<p>Upgrading applications to newer, supported versions of Java has traditionally been a tedious and time-consuming process. Development teams must spend countless hours learning about deprecated APIs, updated libraries, and new language features. In many cases, significant code rewrites are necessary, turning what should be a straightforward upgrade into a multi-week project that diverts resources from building new features.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-duo/duo-amazon-q/\">GitLab Duo with Amazon Q</a> changes this paradigm entirely with AI-powered automation. What once took weeks can now be accomplished in minutes, with full traceability and ready-to-review merge requests that maintain your application's functionality while leveraging modern Java features.</p>\n<h2>How it works: Upgrade your Java application</h2>\n<p>Let's walk through how you can modernize a Java 8 application to Java 17.</p>\n<p><strong>Start with an issue</strong></p>\n<p>First, create an issue in your GitLab project describing your modernization goal. You don't need to specify version details - GitLab Duo with Amazon Q is able to detect that your application is currently built with Java 8 and needs to be upgraded. Simply describe that you want to refactor your code to Java 17 in the issue title and description.</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger the transformation</strong></p>\n<p>Once your issue is created, invoke GitLab Duo with Amazon Q using the <code>/q transform</code> command in a comment on the issue. This simple command sets in motion an automated process that will analyze your entire codebase, create a comprehensive upgrade plan, and generate all necessary code changes.</p>\n<p><strong>Automated analysis and implementation</strong></p>\n<p>Behind the scenes, Amazon Q analyzes your Java 8 codebase to understand your application's structure, dependencies, and implementation patterns. It identifies deprecated features, determines which Java 17 constructs can replace existing code, and creates a merge request with all the necessary updates. The transformation updates not just your source code files \u2014 including CLI, GUI, and model classes \u2014 but also your build configuration files like <code>pom.xml</code> with Java 17 settings and dependencies.</p>\n<p><strong>Review and verification</strong></p>\n<p>The generated merge request provides a complete view of all changes. You can review how your code has been modernized with Java 17 language features and verify that all tests still pass. The beauty of this approach is that all functionality is preserved and your application works exactly the same way, just with improved, more modern code.</p>\n<h2>Why use GitLab Duo with Amazon Q</h2>\n<p>Leveraging GitLab Duo with Amazon Q for application modernization has a number of advantages for development teams:</p>\n<p><strong>Time reduction</strong>: What traditionally takes weeks of developer effort is reduced to hours or minutes, freeing your team to focus on building new features rather than managing technical debt.</p>\n<p><strong>Minimized risk</strong>: The automated analysis and transformation process reduces the risk of human error that often accompanies manual code migrations. Every change is traceable and reviewable through GitLab's merge request workflow.</p>\n<p><strong>Complete audit trail</strong>: Every transformation is documented through GitLab's version control, providing a clear record of what changed and why, which is essential for compliance and troubleshooting.</p>\n<p><strong>Enterprise-grade security</strong>: The integration leverages GitLab's end-to-end security features and AWS's robust cloud infrastructure, helping to ensure your code and data remain protected throughout the modernization process.</p>\n<p>Are you ready to see GitLab Duo with Amazon Q in action?

    "url": "https://about.gitlab.com/blog/delivering-faster-and-smarter-scans-with-advanced-sast/",
    "summary": "<p>Static application security testing (SAST) is critical to building secure software, helping teams identify vulnerabilities in code before they can be exploited. Last year, with GitLab 17.4, we <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/gitlab-advanced-sast-is-now-generally-available/\">launched Advanced SAST</a> to deliver higher-quality scan results directly in developer workflows. Since then, Advanced SAST has powered millions of scans across over a hundred thousand codebases, reducing risk and helping customers build more secure applications from the start.</p>\n<p>We\u2019re building on that foundation with a set of performance enhancements designed to improve accuracy and speed, so developers get results they can trust, without losing their flow. <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/gitlab-18-5-intelligence-that-moves-software-development-forward/\">New capabilities</a> include better out-of-the-box precision, the ability to add custom detection rules, and a trio of improvements to accelerate scan times through multi-core scanning, algorithmic optimizations, and diff-based scanning. Together, these improvements make <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/sast/gitlab_advanced_sast/\">Advanced SAST</a> smarter and faster, delivering security that\u2019s developer-friendly by design.</p>\n<h2>SAST adoption hinges on both accuracy and speed</h2>\n<p>Most SAST programs rarely fail due to inaccurate vulnerability detection; they fail because developers don\u2019t adopt security tooling. Too often, AppSec solutions like SAST deliver accuracy at the expense of the developer experience, or developer experience at the expense of accuracy. In reality, both are necessary. Without accuracy, developers don\u2019t trust the results; without speed and usability, adoption lags.</p>\n<p>When both come together, security fits naturally into the development process \u2014 and that\u2019s the only way security teams successfully drive SAST adoption at scale. This philosophy guides the GitLab roadmap for Advanced SAST.</p>\n<h2>Add custom detection rules for greater accuracy</h2>\n<p>The built-in Advanced SAST rules are informed by our in-house security research team, designed to maximize accuracy out of the box. Until now, you could <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/sast/customize_rulesets/\">disable rules</a> or adjust their name, description, or severity, but you couldn\u2019t add new detection logic. With GitLab 18.5, teams can now define their own custom, pattern-based rules to catch organization-specific issues \u2014 like flagging banned function calls \u2014 while still using GitLab\u2019s curated ruleset as the baseline. Any violations of custom rules are reported in the same place as built-in GitLab rules, so developers can glean information from a single dashboard.</p>\n<p>Custom rules are effective at catching straightforward issues that matter to your organization, but they don\u2019t influence the taint analysis that Advanced SAST uses to catch injections and similar flaws. Customizations are managed through simple TOML files, just like other SAST ruleset configurations. The result is higher-quality scan results tuned to your context, giving security teams more control and developers clearer, more actionable findings.</p>\n<h2>Faster scans to get developers in the flow</h2>\n<p>Speed matters. If a SAST scan takes too long, developers often switch to another task, so adoption suffers.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s why we\u2019ve invested in several performance-based enhancements to dramatically reduce scan times without compromising on accuracy, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Multi-core scanning</strong>: Leverages multiple CPU cores on GitLab Runners</li>\n<li><strong>Diff-based scanning</strong>: Scans only the changed code in a merge request</li>\n<li><strong>Ongoing optimizations</strong>: Smarter algorithms and engine enhancements</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These improvements build on each other, delivering faster scans with significant impact:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Multi-core scanning typically reduces scan runtime by up to <strong>50%.</strong></li>\n<li>Diff-based scanning helps the most in large repositories, where less code is modified in each change. It\u2019s specifically designed to give faster feedback in the code review process by delivering faster scans in merge requests. In our testing, many large repositories now take less than <strong>10 minutes to return results in MRs, where previously scans took more than 20 minutes.</strong></li>\n<li>In recent internal testing, algorithmic optimizations <strong>cut scan times by up to 71%</strong> on large open-source codebases, with Apache Lucene (Java) showing the biggest improvement. Other projects, including Django (Python), Kafka, and Zulip, also saw <strong>performance boosts of over 50% in single-core mode</strong>. You can see the results for yourself below.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For developers, these improvements mean quicker feedback in merge requests, less waiting on security results, and a smoother path to adoption. And with multi-core scanning and diff-based analysis layered on top, the gains will be even greater.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"chart showing Python scan times\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1760714805/rxl2zzo58j7y0k2ldxeq.png\" />\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>\n<p><img alt=\"chart showing Java scan times\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1760714805/hz9bsrir6nrqthkjddvi.png\" /></p>\n<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>These performance gains reflect GitLab\u2019s broader focus on improving the developer experience across our platform. For example, one of our customers recently transitioned to GitLab\u2019s <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/policies/pipeline_execution_policies/\">Pipeline Execution Policies</a> (PEP) to gain greater control and flexibility over how security scans run within their pipelines. By standardizing templates, adding caching, and optimizing pipeline logic, their teams cut dependency scan runtimes from <strong>15\u201360 minutes down to just 1\u20132 minutes per job \u2014 saving roughly 100,000 compute minutes every day across 15,000 scans</strong>. It\u2019s a clear example of how more customizable and efficient pipeline execution policies lead to faster feedback loops, higher productivity, and broader adoption.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>With these latest enhancements, Advanced SAST gives security and development teams the accuracy, speed, and flexibility they need to keep up with modern software development. By reducing false positives, enabling custom detection, and accelerating scan times, we\u2019re making security an enabler \u2014 not a blocker \u2014 for developers.</p>\n<p>Like all of <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/application-security-testing/\">GitLab\u2019s application security capabilities</a>, Advanced SAST is built directly into our DevSecOps platform, making security a natural part of how developers build, test, deploy, and secure software.</p>\n<p>The result: faster adoption, fewer bottlenecks, and more secure applications delivered from the start.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Get started with Advanced SAST today!

    "url": "https://about.gitlab.com/blog/gitlab-18-5-intelligence-that-moves-software-development-forward/",
    "summary": "<p>Software development teams are drowning in noise. Thousands of vulnerabilities flood security dashboards, but only a fraction pose real risk. Developers context-switch between planning backlogs, triaging security findings, reviewing code, and responding to CI/CD failures \u2014 losing hours to manual work. <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2025/10/16/gitlab-18-5-released/\">GitLab 18.5</a> calms this chaos.</p>\n<p>At the heart of this release is a valuable improvement in overall usability of GitLab and how AI integrates into your user experience. A new panel-based UI makes it easier to see data in context, and allows GitLab Duo Chat to be persistently visible across the platform, wherever it is needed. Purpose-built agents tackle vulnerability triage and backlog management, and popular AI tools integrate with agentic workflows even more seamlessly than before. We\u2019ve also extended our market-leading security capabilities to help you better identify exploitable vulnerabilities versus theoretical ones, distinguish active credentials from expired ones, and scan only changed code to keep developers in flow.</p>\n<h2>What\u2019s new in 18.5</h2>\n<p>18.5 represents our biggest release so far this year \u2014 watch our introduction to the release, and read more details below.\n&lt;div style=&quot;padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/1128975773?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;&quot; title=&quot;GitLab_18.5 Release_101925_MP_v2&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>\n<h3>Modern user experience with quick access to GitLab Duo everywhere</h3>\n<p>GitLab 18.5 delivers a modernized user experience with a more intuitive interface driven by a new panel-based layout.</p>\n<p>With panels, key information appears side by side so that you can work contextually, without losing your place. For example, when you click on an issue in the issues list, its details automatically open in a side panel. You can also launch the GitLab Duo panel on the right, bringing Duo wherever you are in GitLab. This lets you ask contextual questions or give instructions, right alongside your work.</p>\n<p>Several usability improvements make navigation easier. The global search box now appears at the top center for improved accessibility. Global navigation elements, including Issues, Merge Requests, To-Dos, and your avatar have moved to the top right. Additionally, the left sidebar is now collapsible and expandable, giving you more control over your workspace.</p>\n<p>Teams using experimental and GitLab Duo beta features will be the first to receive the new interface, followed by all GitLab.com users who will be able to turn this experience on using the toggle located under your user icon. To learn more about this feature, reference our documentation <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/interface_redesign/#turn-new-navigation-on-or-off\">here</a>. Please share your feedback or report any issues <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/577554\">here</a>, you're helping us shape a better GitLab!</p>\n<h3>Updates to GitLab Duo Agent Platform</h3>\n<p><strong>Security Analyst Agent: Transform manual vulnerability triage into intelligent automation</strong></p>\n<p>GitLab Duo <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/duo_agent_platform/agents/foundational_agents/security_analyst_agent/\">Security Analyst Agent</a> automates vulnerability management workflows through AI-powered analysis, helping transform hours of manual triage into intelligent automation. Building on the Vulnerability Management Tools available through GitLab Duo Agentic Chat, Security Analyst Agent orchestrates multiple tools, applying security policies, and creating custom flows for recurring workflows automatically.</p>\n<p>Security teams can access enriched vulnerability data, including CVE details, static reachability analysis, and code flow information, while executing operations like dismissing false positives, confirming threats, adjusting severity levels, and creating linked issues for remediation \u2014 all through conversational AI. The agent reduces repetitive clicking through vulnerability dashboards and replaces custom scripts with simple natural language commands.</p>\n<p>For example, when a security scan reveals dozens of vulnerabilities, simply prompt: &quot;Dismiss vulnerabilities with reachable=FALSE and create issues for critical findings.&quot; Security Analyst Agent analyzes reachability data, applies security policies, and completes bulk operations in moments \u2014 helping decrease work that would otherwise take hours.</p>\n<p>While individual Vulnerability Management Tools can be accessed directly through Agentic Chat for specific tasks, Security Analyst Agent orchestrates these tools intelligently and automates complex multi-step workflows. Note that Vulnerability Management Tools are available through Agentic Chat on GitLab Self-managed and GitLab.com instances, and Security Analyst Agent is available on GitLab.com only for 18.5, while availability in Self-managed and Dedicated environments will come with our next release.\nWatch this demo:</p>\n<p>&lt;div style=&quot;padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/1128975984?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;&quot; title=&quot;18.5 Security Demo&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>GitLab Duo Planner: Turn backlog chaos into strategic clarity</strong></p>\n<p>Managing complex software delivery requires constant context-switching between planning tasks. <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/duo_agent_platform/agents/foundational_agents/planner/\">GitLab Duo Planner</a> addresses the real-world planning challenges we see teams face every day. Duo Planner acts as your teammate with awareness of your project context, including how you manage issues, epics, and merge requests. Unlike generic AI assistants, it's purpose-built with deep knowledge of GitLab's planning workflows coupled with Agile and prioritization frameworks to help you balance effort, risk, and strategic alignment.</p>\n<p>GitLab Duo Planner can turn vague ideas into structured planning hierarchies, identify stale backlog items, and draft executive updates. For example, when refining your backlog with hundreds of issues accumulated over months, simply prompt: &quot;Identify stale backlog items and suggest priorities.&quot; Within seconds, you'll receive a structured summary showing issues without recent activity, items missing key details, duplicate work, and recommended priorities based on labels and milestones, complete with actionable recommendations.</p>\n<p>For teams managing complex roadmaps, the Planner aims to eliminate hours of manual analysis and context-switching, helping Product Managers and engineering leads make faster, more informed decisions. As of 18.5, GitLab Duo Planner is currently \u201cread-only,\u201d meaning that it can analyze, plan, and suggest, but cannot yet take direct action to modify anything. Please see our <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/duo_agent_platform/agents/foundational_agents/planner/\">documentation</a> for more information.</p>\n<p><strong>Extensible Agent Catalog: Popular AI tools as native GitLab agents</strong></p>\n<p>GitLab 18.5 introduces popular AI agents directly into the <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/duo_agent_platform/ai_catalog/\">AI Catalog</a>, making external tools like Claude, OpenAI Codex, Google Gemini CLI, Amazon Q Developer, and OpenCode available as native GitLab agents. Users can now discover, configure, and deploy these agents through the same unified catalog interface used for GitLab's built-in agents, with automatic syncing of foundational agents across organization catalogs.</p>\n<p>This eliminates the complexity of manual agent setup by providing a point-and-click catalog experience while maintaining enterprise-grade security through GitLab's authentication and audit systems. GitLab Duo Enterprise subscriptions now include built-in usage of Claude and Codex within GitLab, allowing you to use your existing GitLab subscription for these tools without requiring separate API keys or additional billing setup. Other agents may still require separate subscriptions and configuration while we finalize our integration plans.</p>\n<p><strong>Self-hosted GitLab Duo Agent Platform (Beta): Address data sovereignty requirements without sacrificing AI power</strong></p>\n<p>GitLab 18.5 moves GitLab Duo Agent Platform's self-hosted capabilities from experimental to beta, enabling organizations to execute AI agents and flows entirely within their own infrastructure \u2014 critical for regulated industries and data sovereignty requirements. The beta release includes improved timeout configurations and AI Gateway settings, allowing teams to use AI agents for code reviews, bug fixes, and feature implementations, while providing enterprise-grade security for sensitive code.</p>\n<h2>Smarter, faster security: Prioritize real risks and keep developers in the flow</h2>\n<p>GitLab 18.5 introduces new application security capabilities that help teams focus on exploitable risk, reduce noise, and strengthen software supply chain security. These updates continue our commitment to building security directly into the development process \u2014 delivering precision, speed, and insight without disrupting developer flow.</p>\n<p><strong>Static Reachability Analysis</strong></p>\n<p>With over <a href=\"https://www.cvedetails.com/\">37,000 new CVEs</a> issued this year, security teams face an overwhelming volume of vulnerabilities and struggle to understand which ones are truly exploitable. Static Reachability Analysis, now in limited availability, brings library-level precision by helping to identify whether vulnerable code is actually invoked in your application, not just present in dependencies.</p>\n<p>Paired with our <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/vulnerabilities/risk_assessment_data/\">recently released</a> Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS) and Known Exploited Vulnerability (KEV) data, security teams can more effectively accelerate vulnerability triage and prioritize real risks to help strengthen overall supply chain security. In 18.5, we\u2019re adding support for Java, alongside existing support for Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript.</p>\n<p><strong>Secret Validity Checks</strong></p>\n<p>Just as Static Reachability Analysis helps teams prioritize exploitable vulnerabilities from open source dependencies, Secret Validity Checks bring the same insight to exposed secrets \u2014 currently available in beta on GitLab.com and GitLab Self-Managed. For GitLab-issued security tokens, instead of manually verifying whether a leaked credential or API key is active, GitLab automatically distinguishes active secrets from expired ones directly in the <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/vulnerability_report/\">Vulnerability Report</a>. This helps enable security and development teams to focus remediation efforts on genuine risks. Support for AWS- and GCP-issued secrets is planned for future releases.</p>\n<p><strong>Custom rules for Advanced SAST</strong></p>\n<p>Advanced SAST runs on rules informed by our in-house security research team, designed to maximize accuracy out of the box. However, some teams required additional flexibility to tune the SAST engine for their specific organization. With Custom Rules for Advanced SAST, AppSec teams can define atomic, pattern-based detection logic to help capture security issues specific to their organization \u2014 like flagging banned function calls \u2014 while still using GitLab\u2019s curated ruleset as the baseline. Customizations are managed through simple TOML files, just like other SAST ruleset configurations. While these rules will not support taint analysis, they do give organizations greater flexibility in achieving accurate SAST results.</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced SAST C and C++ language support</strong></p>\n<p>We\u2019re expanding our language coverage for Advanced SAST to include C and C++, which are widely used languages in embedded systems software development. To enable scanning, projects must generate a compilation database that captures compiler commands and includes paths used during builds. This works to ensure the scanner can accurately parse and analyze source files, delivering precise, context-aware results that help security teams identify real vulnerabilities in the development process. The implementation requirements for C and C++ require specific configurations, which can be found in our <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/sast/cpp_advanced_sast/\">documentation</a>. Advanced SAST C and C++ support are currently available in beta.</p>\n<p><strong>Diff-based SAST scanning</strong></p>\n<p>Traditional SAST scans re-analyze entire codebases with every commit, slowing pipelines and disrupting developer flow. The developer experience is a critical consideration that can make or break the adoption of application security testing. Diff-based SAST scanning aims to speed up scan times by focusing only on the code changed in a merge request, reducing redundant analysis and surfacing relevant results tied to the developer\u2019s work. By aligning scans with actual code changes, GitLab delivers faster, more focused feedback that helps keep developers in flow while maintaining strong security coverage.</p>\n<h2>Simplify API configurations</h2>\n<p>API-driven workflows offer power and flexibility, but they can also create unnecessary complexity for tasks that teams need to perform regularly. The new Maven Virtual Registry interface brings a UI layer to these operations.</p>\n<h3>Maven Virtual Registry interface</h3>\n<p>The new web-based interface for managing Maven Virtual Registries turns complex API configurations into visual simplicity, providing a more intuitive experience for package administrators and platform engineers.</p>\n<p>Previously, teams configured and maintained virtual registries only through API calls, which made routine maintenance time-consuming and required specialized platform knowledge. The new interface removes that barrier, helping to make everyday tasks faster and easier.</p>\n<p>With this update, you can now:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create virtual registries to simplify dependency configuration</li>\n<li>Create and order upstreams to help improve performance and compliance</li>\n<li>Browse and clear stale cache entries directly in the UI</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This visual experience helps reduce operational overhead and provides development teams with clearer insight into how dependencies are resolved, enabling them to make better decisions about build performance and security policies.</p>\n<p>Watch a demo:</p>\n<p>&lt;!-- blank line --&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;video_container&quot;&gt;\n&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/CiOZJPhAvaI?si=cYaoR_OIgqFKbyM2&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;!-- blank line --&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>\n<p>We invite enterprise customers to join the <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/543045\">Maven Virtual Registry Beta program</a> and share feedback to help shape the final release.</p>\n<h2>AI that adapts to your workflow</h2>\n<p>This release represents more than new capabilities \u2014 it's about choice and control.

    "url": "https://about.gitlab.com/blog/variable-and-artifact-sharing-in-gitlab-parent-child-pipelines/",
    "summary": "<p>Software projects have different evolving needs and requirements. Some have\nsaid that <em>software is never finished, merely abandoned</em>. Some software\nprojects are small and others are large with complex integrations. Some have\ndependencies on external projects, while others are self-contained.\nRegardless of the size and complexity, the need to validate and ensure\nfunctionality remains paramount.</p>\n<p>CI/CD pipelines can help with the challenge of building and validating software projects consistently, but, much like the software itself, these pipelines can become complex with many dependencies. This is where ideas like <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/pipelines/downstream_pipelines/#parent-child-pipelines\">parent-child pipelines</a> and data exchange in CI/CD setups become incredibly important.</p>\n<p>In this article, we will cover common CI/CD data exchange challenges users may encounter with parent-child pipelines in GitLab \u2014 and how to solve them. You'll learn how to turn complex CI/CD processes into more manageable setups.</p>\n<h2>Using parent-child pipelines</h2>\n<p>The pipeline setup in the image below illustrates a scenario where a project could require a large, complex pipeline. The whole project resides in one repository and contains different modules. Each module requires its own set of build and test automation steps.</p>\n<p>One approach to address the CI/CD configuration in a scenario like this is to break down the larger pipeline into smaller ones (i.e., child pipelines) and keep a common CI/CD process that is shared across all modules in charge of the whole orchestration (i.e., parent pipeline).</p>\n<p><img alt=\"CI/CD configuration\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1760617772/hizwvhmgxn6exbmvsnrv.png\" /></p>\n<p>The parent-child pipeline pattern allows a single pipeline to orchestrate one or many downstream pipelines. Similar to how a single pipeline coordinates the execution of multiple <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/jobs/\">jobs</a>, the parent pipeline coordinates the running of full pipelines with one or more jobs.</p>\n<p>This pattern has been shown to be helpful in a variety of use cases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Breaking down large, complex pipelines into smaller, manageable pieces</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Conditionally executing certain pipelines as part of a larger CI/CD process</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Executing pipelines in parallel</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Helping manage user permissions to access and run certain pipelines</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>GitLab\u2019s current CI/CD structure supports this pattern and makes it simple to implement parent-child pipelines. While there are many benefits when using the parent-child pipeline pattern with GitLab, one question we often get is how to share data between the parent and child pipelines. In the next sections, we\u2019ll go over how to make use of GitLab variables and artifacts to address this concern.</p>\n<h3>Sharing variables</h3>\n<p>There are cases where it is necessary to pass the output from a parent pipeline job to a child pipeline. These outputs can be shared as variables, <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/jobs/job_artifacts/\">artifacts</a>, and <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/inputs/\">inputs</a>.</p>\n<p>Consider a case where we create a custom variable <code>var_1</code> during the runtime of a job:</p>\n<pre><code>\nstages:\n  - build\n  - triggers\n\n# This job only creates a variable \n\ncreate_var_job:\n  stage: build\n  script:\n    - var_1=&quot;Hi, I'm a Parent pipeline variable&quot;\n    - echo &quot;var_1=$var_1&quot; &gt;&gt; var.env\n  artifacts:\n    reports:\n      dotenv: var.env\n</code></pre>\n<p>Notice that the variable is created as part of the script steps in the job (during runtime). In this example, we are using a simple string <code>&quot;Hi, I'm a Parent pipeline variable&quot;</code> to illustrate the main syntax required to later share this variable with a child pipeline. Let's break down the <code>create_var_job</code>  and analyze the main steps from this GitLab job</p>\n<p>First, we need to save <code>var_1</code> as <code>dotenv</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>  script:\n    - var_1=&quot;Hi, I'm a pipeline variable&quot;\n    - echo &quot;var_1=$var_1&quot; &gt;&gt; var.env\n</code></pre>\n<p>After saving <code>var_1</code> as <code>var.env</code>, the next important step is to make this variable available as an artifact produced by the <code>create_var_job</code>. To do that, we use the following syntax:</p>\n<pre><code>\nartifacts:\n    reports:\n      dotenv: var.env\n</code></pre>\n<p>Up to this point, we have created a variable during runtime and saved it as a <code>dotenv</code> report. Now let's add the job that should trigger the child pipeline:</p>\n<pre><code>\ntelco_service_a:\n  stage: triggers\n  trigger:\n    include: service_a/.gitlab-ci.yml\n  rules:\n    - changes:\n        - service_a/*\n</code></pre>\n<p>The goal of <code>telco_service_a</code>  job is to find the <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> configuration of the child pipeline,  which is defined in this case as <code>service_a,</code> and trigger its execution. Let's examine this job:</p>\n<pre><code>\ntelco_service_a:\n  stage: triggers\n  trigger:\n    include: service_a/.gitlab-ci.yml\n</code></pre>\n<p>We see it belongs to another <code>stage</code> of the pipeline named <code>triggers.</code>This job will run only after <code>create_var_job</code> from the first stage successfully finishes and where the variable  <code>var_1</code> we want to pass is created.</p>\n<p>After defining the stage, we use the reserved words <code>trigger</code> and <code>include</code> to tell GitLab where to search for the child pipeline configuration, as illustrated in the YAML below:</p>\n<pre><code>  trigger:\n    include: service_a/.gitlab-ci.yml\n</code></pre>\n<p>Our child-pipeline YAML configuration is under <code>service_a/.gitlab-ci.yml</code> folder in the GitLab repository, for this example.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"child-pipeline YAML configuration\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1760617772/ujkirpbifthpuujkcm6f.png\" /></p>\n<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Child pipelines folders with configurations&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>\n<p>Take into consideration that the repository structure depicted above can vary. What matters is properly pointing the  <code>triggers: include</code> properties at the location of your child-pipeline configuration in your repository.</p>\n<p>Finally, we use <code>rules: changes</code> to indicate to GitLab that this child pipeline should be triggered only if there is any change in any file in the <code>service_a/.gitlab-ci.yml</code> directory, as illustrated in the following code snippet:</p>\n<pre><code>\nrules:\n    - changes:\n        - service_a/*\n</code></pre>\n<p>Using this rule helps to optimize cost by triggering the child pipeline job only when necessary. This approach is particularly valuable in a monorepo architecture where specific modules contain numerous components, allowing us to avoid running their dedicated pipelines when no changes have been made to their respective codebases.</p>\n<h4>Configuring the parent pipeline</h4>\n<p>Up to this point, we have put together our parent pipeline. Here's the full code snippet for this segment:</p>\n<pre><code>\n# Parent Pipeline Configuration\n\n# This pipeline creates a custom variable and triggers a child pipeline\n\n\nstages:\n  - build\n  - trigger\n\ncreate_var_job:\n  stage: build\n  script:\n    - var_1=&quot;Hi, I'm a Parent pipeline variable&quot;\n    - echo &quot;var_1=$var_1&quot; &gt;&gt; var.env\n  artifacts:\n    reports:\n      dotenv: var.env\n\ntelco_service_a:\n  stage: triggers\n  trigger:\n    include: service_a/.gitlab-ci.yml\n  rules:\n    - changes:\n        - service_a/*\n</code></pre>\n<p>When GitLab executes the YAML configuration in the GitLab UI, the parent pipeline gets rendered as follows:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"parent pipeline rendering\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1760617771/e1azkkr0rnzd42dzkw1x.png\" /></p>\n<p>Notice the label &quot;trigger job,&quot; which indicates this job will start the execution of another pipeline configuration.</p>\n<h4>Configuring the child pipeline</h4>\n<p>Moving forward, let's now focus on the child pipeline configuration, where we expect to inherit and print the value of the <code>var_1</code> created in the parent pipeline.</p>\n<p>The pipeline configuration in <code>service_a/.gitlab_ci.yml</code> has the following definition:</p>\n<pre><code>\nstages:\n  - build\n\nbuild_a:\n  stage: build\n  script:\n    - echo &quot;this job inherits the variable from the Parent pipeline:&quot;\n    - echo $var_1\n  needs:\n    - project: gitlab-da/use-cases/7-4-parent-child-pipeline\n      job: create_var_job\n      ref: main\n      artifacts: true\n</code></pre>\n<p>Like before, let's break down this pipeline and highlight the main parts to achieve our goal. This pipeline only contains one stage (i.e., <code>build)</code> and one job (i.e., <code>build_a)</code>. The script in the job contains two steps:</p>\n<pre><code>\nbuild_a:\n  stage: build\n  script:\n    - echo &quot;this job inherits the variable from the Parent pipeline:&quot;\n    - echo $var_1\n</code></pre>\n<p>These two steps print output during the execution. The most interesting one is the second step, <code>echo $var_1</code>, where we expect to print the variable value inherited from the parent pipeline. Remember, this was a simple string with value: <code>&quot;Hi, I'm a Parent pipeline variable.&quot;</code></p>\n<h4>Inheriting variables using needs</h4>\n<p>To set and link this job to inherit variables from the parent pipeline, we use the reserved GitLab CI properties <code>needs</code> as depicted in the following snippet:</p>\n<pre><code>\nneeds:\n    - project: gitlab-da/use-cases/7-4-parent-child-pipeline\n      job: create_var_job\n      ref: main\n      artifacts: true\n</code></pre>\n<p>Using the &quot;needs&quot; keyword, we define dependencies that must be completed before running this job. In this case, we pass four different values. Let's walk through each one  of them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Project:</strong> The complete namespace of the project where the main <code>gitlab-ci.yml</code> containing the parent pipeline YAML is located. Make sure to include the absolute path.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Job:</strong> The specific job name in the parent pipeline from where we want to inherit the variable.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Ref:</strong> The name of the branch where the main <code>gitlab-ci.yml</code> containing the parent pipeline YAML is located.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Artifacts:</strong> Where we set a boolean value, indicating that artifacts from the parent pipeline job should be downloaded and made available to this child pipeline job.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> This specific approach using the needs property is only available to GitLab Premium and Ultimate users. We will cover another example for GitLab community users later on.</p>\n<h4>Putting it all together</h4>\n<p>Now let's assume we make a change to any of the files under <code>service_a</code> folder and commit the changes to the repository. When GitLab detects the change, the rule we set up will trigger the child job pipeline execution. This gets displayed in the GitLab UI as follows:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Rule triggering the child job pipeline execution\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1760617771/e1azkkr0rnzd42dzkw1x.png\" /></p>\n<p>Clicking on the <code>telco_service_a</code>  will take us to the jobs in the child pipeline:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Jobs in pipeline\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1760617773/vftjkg7ct2wqmew1e3yk.png\" /></p>\n<p>We can see the parent-child relationship, and finally, by clicking on the <code>build_a job</code>, we can visually verify the variable inheritance in the job execution log:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Verifying the variable inheritance in the job execution log\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1760617758/hxfkfmev9hebbqhgcvoh.png\" /></p>\n<p>This output confirms the behavior we expected. The custom runtime variable <code>var_1</code> created in the parent job is inherited in the child job, unpacked from the <code>dotenv</code> report, and its value accessible as can be confirmed in Line 26 above.</p>\n<p>This use case illustrates how to share custom variables that can contain any value between pipelines. This example is intentionally simple and can be extrapolated to more realistic scenarios. Take, for instance, the following CI/CD configuration, where the custom variable we need to share is the tag of a Docker image:</p>\n<pre><code>\n# Pipeline \n\n\nbuild-prod-image:\n  tags: [ saas-linux-large-amd64 ]\n  image: docker:20.10.16\n  stage: build\n  services:\n    - docker:20.10.16-dind\n  \n  script:\n    - docker login -u $CI_REGISTRY_USER -p $CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD $CI_REGISTRY\n    - docker build -t $PRODUCTION_IMAGE .\n    - docker push $PRODUCTION_IMAGE\n    - echo &quot;UPSTREAM_CONTAINER_IMAGE=$PRODUCTION_IMAGE&quot; &gt;&gt; prodimage.env\n\n  artifacts:\n    reports:\n      dotenv: prodimage.env\n\n  rules:\n      - if: '$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == &quot;main&quot;'\n        when: always\n      - when: never\n</code></pre>\n<p>And use the variable with the Docker image tag, in another job that updates a Helm manifest file:</p>\n<pre><code>\nupdate-helm-values:\n    stage: update-manifests\n    image:\n        name: alpine:3.16\n        entrypoint: [&quot;&quot;]\n  \n    before_script:\n          - apk add --no-cache git curl bash yq\n          - git remote set-url origin https://${CI_USERNAME}:${GITOPS_USER}@${SERVER_PATH}/${PROJECT_PATH}\n          - git config --global user.email &quot;gitlab@gitlab.com&quot;\n          - git config --global user.name &quot;GitLab GitOps&quot;\n          - git pull origin main\n    script:\n          - cd src\n          - echo $UPSTREAM_CONTAINER_IMAGE\n          - yq eval -i &quot;.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image |= \\&quot;$UPSTREAM_CONTAINER_IMAGE\\&quot;&quot; store-deployment.yaml\n          - cat store-deployment.yaml\n          - git pull origin main\n          - git checkout -B main\n          - git commit -am '[skip ci] prod image update'\n          - git push origin main\n    needs:\n      - project: gitlab-da/use-cases/devsecops-platform/simply-find/simply-find-front-end\n        job: build-prod-image\n        ref: main\n        artifacts: true\n</code></pre>\n<p>Mastering how to share variables between pipelines while maintaining the relationship between them enables us to create more sophisticated workflow orchestration that can meet our software building needs.</p>\n<h3>Using GitLab Package Registry to share artifacts</h3>\n<p>While the needs feature mentioned above works great for Premium and Ultimate users, GitLab also has features to help achieve similar results for Community Edition users. One suggested approach is to store artifacts in the <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/packages/package_registry/\">GitLab Package Registry</a>.</p>\n<p>Using a combination of the variables provided in GitLab CI/CD jobs and the GitLab API, you can upload artifacts to the GitLab Package Registry from a parent pipeline. In the child pipeline, you can then access the uploaded artifact from the package registry using the same variables and API to access the artifact. Let\u2019s take a look at the example pipeline and some supplementary scripts that illustrate this:</p>\n<p><strong>gitlab-ci.yml (parent pipeline)</strong></p>\n<pre><code>\n# Parent Pipeline Configuration\n\n# This pipeline creates an artifact, uploads it to Package Registry, and triggers a child pipeline\n\n\nstages:\n  - create-upload\n  - trigger\n\nvariables:\n  PACKAGE_NAME: &quot;pipeline-artifacts&quot;\n  PACKAGE_VERSION: &quot;$CI_PIPELINE_ID&quot;\n  ARTIFACT_FILE: &quot;artifact.txt&quot;\n\n# Job 1: Create and upload artifact to Package Registry\n\ncreate-and-upload-artifact:\n  stage: create-upload\n  image: alpine:latest\n  before_script:\n    - apk add --no-cache curl bash\n  script:\n    - bash scripts/create-artifact.sh\n    - bash scripts/upload-to-registry.sh\n  rules:\n    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == &quot;push&quot;\n\n# Job 2: Trigger child pipeline\n\ntrigger-child:\n  stage: trigger\n  trigger:\n    include: child-pipeline.yml\n    strategy: depend\n  variables:\n    PARENT_PIPELINE_ID: $CI_PIPELINE_ID\n    PACKAGE_NAME: $PACKAGE_NAME\n    PACKAGE_VERSION: $PACKAGE_VERSION\n    ARTIFACT_FILE: $ARTIFACT_FILE\n  rules:\n    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == &quot;push&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>child-pipeline.yml</strong></p>\n<pre><code>\n# Child Pipeline Configuration\n\n# This pipeline downloads the artifact from Package Registry and processes it\n\n\nstages:\n  - download-process\n\nvariables:\n  # These variables are passed from the parent pipeline\n  PACKAGE_NAME: &quot;pipeline-artifacts&quot;\n  PACKAGE_VERSION: &quot;$PARENT_PIPELINE_ID&quot;\n  ARTIFACT_FILE: &quot;artifact.txt&quot;\n\n# Job 1: Download and process artifact from Package Registry\n\ndownload-and-process-artifact:\n  stage: download-process\n  image: alpine:latest\n  before_script:\n    - apk add --no-cache curl bash\n  script:\n    - bash scripts/download-from-registry.sh\n    - echo &quot;Processing downloaded artifact...&quot;\n    - cat $ARTIFACT_FILE\n    - echo &quot;Artifact processed successfully!&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>upload-to-registry.sh</strong></p>\n<pre><code>\n#!/bin/bash\n\n\nset -e\n\n\n# Configuration\n\nPACKAGE_NAME=&quot;${PACKAGE_NAME:-pipeline-artifacts}&quot;\n\nPACKAGE_VERSION=&quot;${PACKAGE_VERSION:-$CI_PIPELINE_ID}&quot;\n\nARTIFACT_FILE=&quot;${ARTIFACT_FILE:-artifact.txt}&quot;\n\n\n# Validate required variables\n\nif [ -z &quot;$CI_PROJECT_ID&quot; ]; then\n    echo &quot;Error: CI_PROJECT_ID is not set&quot;\n    exit 1\nfi\n\n\nif [ -z &quot;$CI_JOB_TOKEN&quot; ]; then\n    echo &quot;Error: CI_JOB_TOKEN is not set&quot;\n    exit 1\nfi\n\n\nif [ -z &quot;$CI_API_V4_URL&quot; ]; then\n    echo &quot;Error: CI_API_V4_URL is not set&quot;\n    exit 1\nfi\n\n\nif [ !

The script gives the artifact a name and version and constructs the API call to upload the file to the package registry. The parent pipeline is able to authenticate using a <code>$CI_JOB_TOKEN</code> to push the artifact.txt file to the registry.</p>\n<p>The child pipeline operates the same as the parent pipeline by using a script to construct the API call to download the artifact.txt file from the package registry. It also is able to authenticate to the registry using the <code>$CI_JOB_TOKEN</code>.</p>\n<p>Since the GitLab Package Registry is available to all GitLab users, it helps to serve as a central location for storing and versioning artifacts. It is a great option for users working with many kinds of artifacts and needing to version artifacts for workflows even beyond CI/CD.</p>\n<h3>Using inputs to pass variables to a child pipeline</h3>\n<p>If you made it this far in this tutorial, and you have plans to start creating new pipeline configurations, you might want to start by evaluating if your use case can benefit from using <strong>inputs</strong> to pass variables to other pipelines.</p>\n<p>Using inputs is a recommended way to pass variables when you need to define specific values in a CI/CD job and have those values remain fixed during the pipeline run. Inputs might offer certain advantages over the method we implemented before. For example, with inputs, you can include data validation through options (i.e., values must be one of these: [\u2018staging', \u2018prod\u2019]), variable descriptions, type checking, and assign default values before the pipeline run.</p>\n<h4>Configuring CI/CD inputs</h4>\n<p>Consider the following parent pipeline configuration:</p>\n<pre><code>\n# .gitlab-ci.yml (main file)\n\nstages:\n  - trigger\n\ntrigger-staging:\n  stage: trigger\n  trigger:\n    include:\n      - local: service_a/.gitlab-ci.yml\n        inputs:\n          environment: staging\n          version: &quot;1.0.0&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Let's zoom in at the main difference between the code snippet above and the previous parent pipeline examples in this tutorial:</p>\n<pre><code>\ntrigger:\n    include:\n      - local: service_a/.gitlab-ci.yml\n        inputs:\n          environment: staging\n          version: &quot;1.0.0&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The main difference is using the reserved word &quot;inputs&quot;. This part of the YAML configuration can be read in natural language as: \u201ctrigger the child pipeline defined in <code>service_a.gitlab-ci.yml</code> and make sure to pass \u2018environment: staging\u2019 and \u2018version:1.0.0\u2019 as input variables that the child pipeline will know how to use.</p>\n<h4>Reading CI/CD inputs in child pipelines</h4>\n<p>Moving to the child pipeline, it must contain in its declaration a spec that defines the inputs it can take. For each input, it is possible to add a little description, a set of predefined options the input value can take, and the type of value it will take. This is illustrated as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>\n# target pipeline or child-pipeline in this case\n\n\nspec:\n  inputs:\n    environment:\n      description: &quot;Deployment environment&quot;\n      options: [staging, production]\n    version:\n      type: string\n      description: &quot;Application version&quot;\n\n\n---\n\n\nstages:\n  - deploy\n# Jobs that will use the inputs\n\ndeploy:\n  stage: deploy\n  script:\n      -  echo &quot;Deploying version $[[ inputs.version ]] to $[[ inputs.environment ]]&quot;\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>Notice from the code snippet that after defining the spec, there is a YAML document separator &quot;---&quot;  followed by the actual child pipeline definition where we access the variables <code>$[[ inputs.version ]]</code> and <code>$[[ inputs.environment ]]&quot;</code> from the defined inputs using input interpolation.</p>\n<h2>Get hands-on with parent-child pipelines, artifacts, and more</h2>\n<p>We hope this article has helped with navigating the challenge of sharing variables and artifacts in parent-child pipeline setups.</p>\n<p>To try these examples for yourself, feel free to view or fork the <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/use-cases/devsecops-platform/devops-platform-wave/scenarios/scenario7-deep-dive-into-build-automation-and-ci/7-4-parent-child-pipeline/-/tree/main\">Premium/Ultimate</a> and the <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/playground/dhelfand/parent-child-pipeline-with-package-registry-artifacts\">GitLab Package Registry</a> examples of sharing artifacts.</p>\n<p>You can also sign up for a <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/free-trial/\">30-day free trial of GitLab Ultimate</a> to experience all the features GitLab has to offer.

    "url": "https://about.gitlab.com/blog/how-we-built-a-structured-streamlit-application-framework-in-snowflake/",
    "summary": "<p>Recently, the GitLab Data team transformed scattered <a href=\"https://streamlit.io/\">Streamlit</a> applications into a unified, secure, and scalable solution for our Snowflake environment. To accomplish this, we packed Python, Snowflake, and Streamlit together with GitLab. Follow along on this journey and discover the results we achieved, and learn how you can, too.</p>\n<h2>The challenge</h2>\n<p>Imagine this scenario: Your organization has dozens of Streamlit applications across different environments, running various Python versions, connecting to sensitive data with inconsistent security practices. Some apps work, others break mysteriously, and nobody knows who built what or how to maintain them.</p>\n<p>This was exactly the challenge our data team faced. Applications were being created in isolation, with no standardization, no security oversight, and no clear deployment process. The result? A compliance nightmare and a maintenance burden that was growing exponentially.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Functional architectural design (high level)\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1760035999/i50lpkrwy9bok056rdak.png\" />\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Functional architectural design (high level)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</p>\n<h2>How we started</h2>\n<p>We leveraged our unique position as customer zero by building this entire framework on GitLab's own CI/CD infrastructure and project management tools. Here are the ingredients we started with:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/platform/\">GitLab</a> (product)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/platform/\">Snowflake</a> - our single source of truth (SSOT) for the data warehouse activities (and more than that)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://streamlit.io/\">Streamlit</a> - an open-source tool for visual applications that has pure Python code under the hood\nThis provided us with immediate access to enterprise-grade DevSecOps capabilities, enabling us to implement automated testing, code review processes, and deployment pipelines from the outset. By utilizing GitLab's built-in features for issue tracking, merge requests, and automated deployments (CI/CD pipelines), we can iterate rapidly and validate the framework against real-world enterprise requirements. This internal-first approach ensured our solution was battle-tested on GitLab's own infrastructure before any external implementation.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>The lessons we learned</h3>\n<p>The most critical lesson we learned from building the Streamlit Application Framework in Snowflake is that <strong>structure beats chaos every time</strong> \u2014 implement governance early rather than retrofitting it later when maintenance becomes exponential.\nYou also need to clearly define roles and responsibilities, separating infrastructure concerns from application development, so that each team can focus on its strengths.\nSecurity and compliance cannot be afterthoughts; they must be built into templates and automated processes from day one, as it's far easier to enforce consistent standards upfront than to force them after the fact. Invest heavily in automation and CI/CD pipelines, as manual processes don't scale and introduce human error.\n<img alt=\"Architecture of the framework (general overview)\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1760035998/qt9gfemxjnj8kjumkuh7.png\" />\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Architecture of the framework (general overview)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</p>\n<h2>How the Streamlit Application Framework changes everything</h2>\n<p>The Streamlit Application Framework turns a scattered approach into a structure. It gives developers freedom within secure guardrails, while automating deployment and eliminating maintenance complexity.</p>\n<h3>Three clear roles, one unified process</h3>\n<p>The framework introduces a structured approach with three distinct roles:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Maintainers</strong> (Data team members and contributors) handle the infrastructure, including CI/CD pipelines, security templates, and compliance rules. They ensure the framework runs smoothly and stays secure.</li>\n<li><strong>Creators</strong> (those who need to build applications) can focus on what they do best: creating visualizations, connecting to Snowflake data, and building user experiences. They have full flexibility to create new applications from scratch, add new pages to existing apps, integrate additional Python libraries, and build complex data visualisations \u2014 all without worrying about deployment pipelines or security configurations.</li>\n<li><strong>Viewers</strong> (end users) access polished, secure applications without any technical overhead. All they need is Snowflake access.\n<img alt=\"Roles overview and their functionality\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1760035999/oatqyx3ug7vsgzishpma.png\" />\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Overview of roles and their functions&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Automate everything</h2>\n<p>By implementing CI/CD, days of manual deployments and configuration headaches are gone. The framework provides:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>One-click environment preparation:</strong> With a set of <code>make</code> commands, the environment is installed and ready in a few seconds.</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">================================================================================\n\u2705 Snowflake CLI successfully installed and configured!\nConnection: gitlab_streamlit\nUser: YOU@GITLAB.COM\nAccount: gitlab\n================================================================================\nUsing virtualenv: /Users/YOU/repos/streamlit/.venv\n\ud83d\udcda Installing project dependencies...\nInstalling dependencies from lock file\nNo dependencies to install or update\n\u2705 Streamlit environment prepared!\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Automated CI/CD pipelines:</strong> Handle testing, code review, and deployment from development to production.</li>\n<li><strong>Secure sandbox environments:</strong> Provide for safe development and testing before production deployment.</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">\u2570\u2500$ make streamlit-rules\n\ud83d\udd0d Running Streamlit compliance check...\n================================================================================\nCODE COMPLIANCE REPORT\n================================================================================\nGenerated: 2025-07-09 14:01:16\nFiles checked: 1\n\nSUMMARY:\n\u2705 Passed: 1\n\u274c Failed: 0\nSuccess Rate: 100.0%\n\nAPPLICATION COMPLIANCE SUMMARY:\n\ud83d\udcf1 Total Applications Checked: 1\n\u26a0\ufe0f Applications with Issues: 0\n\ud83d\udcca File Compliance Rate: 100.0%\n\nDETAILED RESULTS BY APPLICATION:\n...\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Template-based application creation:</strong> Ensures consistency across all applications and pages.</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">\u2570\u2500$ make streamlit-new-page STREAMLIT_APP=sales_dashboard STREAMLIT_PAGE_NAME=analytics\n\ud83d\udcdd Generating new Streamlit page: analytics for app: sales_dashboard\n\ud83d\udcc3 Create new page from template:\nPage name: analytics\nApp directory: sales_dashboard\nTemplate path: page_template.py\n\u2705 Successfully created 'analytics.py' in 'sales_dashboard' directory from template\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Poetry-based dependency management:</strong> Prevents version conflicts and maintains clean environments.</li>\n<li><strong>Organized project structure:</strong> Has dedicated folders for applications, templates, compliance rules, and configuration management.</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">\u251c\u2500\u2500 src/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 applications/     # Folder for Streamlit applications\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 main_app/     # Main dashboard application\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 components/   # Shared components\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 &lt;your_apps&gt;/  # Your custom application\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 &lt;your_apps2&gt;/ # Your 2nd custom application\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 templates/        # Application and page templates\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 compliance/       # Compliance rules and checks\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 setup/            # Setup and configuration utilities\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 tests/                # Test files\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 config.yml            # Environment configuration\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Makefile              # Build and deployment automation\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 README.md             # Main README.md file\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Streamlined workflow:</strong> Takes local development through testing schema to production, all automated through GitLab CI/CD pipelines.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"GitLab CI/CD pipelines for full automation of the process\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1760035998/usyma2jkgiazu9iay1au.png\" />\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;GitLab CI/CD pipelines for full automation of the process&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</p>\n<h2>Security and compliance by design</h2>\n<p>Instead of bolting on security as an afterthought, the structured Streamlit Application Framework builds it in from the ground up. Every application adheres to the same security standards, and compliance requirements are automatically enforced. Audit trails are maintained throughout the development lifecycle.\nWe introduce our compliance rules and verify them with a single command. For instance, we can list which classes and methods are mandatory to use, which files you should have, and which roles are allowed and which are forbidden to share the application with. The rules are flexible and descriptive; all you need to do is define them in a YAML file:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">class_rules:\n  - name: &quot;Inherit code for the page from GitLabDataStreamlitInit&quot;\n    description: &quot;All Streamlit apps must inherit from GitLabDataStreamlitInit&quot;\n    severity: &quot;error&quot;\n    required: true\n    class_name: &quot;*&quot;\n    required_base_classes:\n      - &quot;GitLabDataStreamlitInit&quot;\n    required_methods:\n      - &quot;__init__&quot;\n      - &quot;set_page_layout&quot;\n      - &quot;setup_ui&quot;\n      - &quot;run&quot;\n\nfunction_rules:\n  - name: &quot;Main function required&quot;\n    description: &quot;Must have a main() function&quot;\n    severity: &quot;error&quot;\n    required: true\n    function_name: &quot;main&quot;\n\nimport_rules:\n  - name: &quot;Import GitLabDataStreamlitInit&quot;\n    description: &quot;Must import the mandatory base class&quot;\n    severity: &quot;error&quot;\n    required: true\n    module_name: &quot;gitlab_data_streamlit_init&quot;\n    required_items:\n      - &quot;GitLabDataStreamlitInit&quot;\n  - name: &quot;Import streamlit&quot;\n    description: &quot;Must import streamlit library&quot;\n    severity: &quot;error&quot;\n    required: true\n    module_name: &quot;streamlit&quot;\n\nfile_rules:\n  - name: &quot;Snowflake configuration required (snowflake.yml)&quot;\n    description: &quot;Each application must have a snowflake.yml configuration file&quot;\n    severity: &quot;error&quot;\n    required: true\n    file_pattern: &quot;**/applications/**/snowflake.yml&quot;\n    base_path: &quot;&quot;\n  - name: &quot;Snowflake environment required (environment.yml)&quot;\n    description: &quot;Each application must have a environment.yml configuration file&quot;\n    severity: &quot;error&quot;\n    required: true\n    file_pattern: &quot;**/applications/**/environment.yml&quot;\n    base_path: &quot;&quot;\n  - name: &quot;Share specification required (share.yml)&quot;\n    description: &quot;Each application must have a share.yml file&quot;\n    severity: &quot;warning&quot;\n    required: true\n    file_pattern: &quot;**/applications/**/share.yml&quot;\n    base_path: &quot;&quot;\n  - name: &quot;README.md required (README.md)&quot;\n    description: &quot;Each application should have a README.md file with a proper documentation&quot;\n    severity: &quot;error&quot;\n    required: true\n    file_pattern: &quot;**/applications/**/README.md&quot;\n    base_path: &quot;&quot;\n  - name: &quot;Starting point recommended (dashboard.py)&quot;\n    description: &quot;Each application must have a dashboard.py as a starting point&quot;\n    severity: &quot;warning&quot;\n    required: true\n    file_pattern: &quot;**/applications/**/dashboard.py&quot;\n    base_path: &quot;&quot;\n\nsql_rules:\n  - name: &quot;SQL files must contain only SELECT statements&quot;\n    description: &quot;SQL files and SQL code in other files should only contain SELECT statements for data safety&quot;\n    severity: &quot;error&quot;\n    required: true\n    file_extensions: [&quot;.sql&quot;, &quot;.py&quot;]\n    select_only: true\n    forbidden_statements:\n      - ....\n    case_sensitive: false\n  - name: &quot;SQL queries should include proper SELECT statements&quot;\n    description: &quot;When SQL is present, it should contain proper SELECT statements&quot;\n    severity: &quot;warning&quot;\n    required: false\n    file_extensions: [&quot;.sql&quot;, &quot;.py&quot;]\n    required_statements:\n      - &quot;SELECT&quot;\n    case_sensitive: false\n\nshare_rules:\n  - name: &quot;Valid functional roles in share.yml&quot;\n    description: &quot;Share.yml files must contain only valid functional roles from the approved list&quot;\n    severity: &quot;error&quot;\n    required: true\n    file_pattern: &quot;**/applications/**/share.yml&quot;\n    valid_roles:\n      - ...\n    safe_data_roles:\n      - ...\n  - name: &quot;Share.yml file format validation&quot;\n    description: &quot;Share.yml files must follow the correct YAML format structure&quot;\n    severity: &quot;error&quot;\n    required: true\n    file_pattern: &quot;**/applications/**/share.yml&quot;\n    required_keys:\n      - &quot;share&quot;\n    min_roles: 1\n    max_roles: 10\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>With one command running:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">\u2570\u2500$ make streamlit-rules\n</code></pre>\n<p>We can verify all the rules we have created and validate that the developers (who are building a Streamlit application) are following the policy specified by the creators (who determine the policies and building blocks of the framework), and that all the building blocks are in the right place.

    "summary": "<p>For the past six years, I've worked on artifact management at GitLab and have had hundreds of conversations with platform engineers trying to solve the same challenge: managing artifacts when they've become a sprawling, expensive mess. What started as simple Docker registries and Maven repositories has evolved into a complex web of tools, policies, and operational overhead that's consuming more time and budget than anyone anticipated.</p>\n<p>I recently spoke with a platform engineer at a Fortune 500 company who told me, &quot;I spend more time managing artifact repositories than I do on actual platform improvements.&quot; That conversation reminded me why we need an honest discussion about the real costs of fragmented artifact management \u2014 and what platform teams can realistically do about it. This article will help you better understand the problem and how GitLab can help you solve it through strategic consolidation.</p>\n<h2>Real-world impact: The numbers</h2>\n<p>Based on data from our customers and industry research, fragmented artifact management typically results in the following costs for a midsize organization (500+ developers):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Licensing:</strong> $50,000-200,000 annually across multiple tools</li>\n<li><strong>Operational overhead:</strong> 2-3 FTE's equivalent time spent on artifact management tasks</li>\n<li><strong>Storage inefficiency:</strong> 20%-30% higher storage costs due to duplication and poor lifecycle management</li>\n<li><strong>Developer productivity loss:</strong> 15-20 minutes daily per developer due to artifact-related friction</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For large enterprises, these numbers multiply significantly. One customer calculated they were spending over $500,000 annually just on the operational overhead of managing seven different artifact storage systems.</p>\n<p>The hidden costs compound daily:</p>\n<p><strong>Time multiplication:</strong> Every lifecycle policy, security rule, or access control change must be implemented across multiple systems. What should be a 15-minute configuration becomes hours of work.</p>\n<p><strong>Security gap risks:</strong> Managing security policies across disparate systems creates blind spots. Vulnerability scanning, access controls, and audit trails become fragmented.</p>\n<p><strong>Context switching tax:</strong> Developers lose productivity when they can't find artifacts or need to remember which system stores what.</p>\n<h2>The multiplication problem</h2>\n<p>The artifact management landscape has exploded. Where teams once managed a single Maven repository, today's platform engineers juggle:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Container registries (Docker Hub, ECR, GCR, Azure ACR)</li>\n<li>Package repositories (JFrog Artifactory, Sonatype Nexus)</li>\n<li>Language-specific registries (npm, PyPI, NuGet, Conan)</li>\n<li>Infrastructure artifacts (Terraform modules, Helm charts)</li>\n<li>ML model registries (MLflow, Weights &amp; Biases)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each tool comes with its own authentication system, lifecycle policies, security scanning, and operational requirements. For organizations with hundreds or thousands of projects, this creates an exponential management burden.</p>\n<h2>GitLab's strategic approach: Depth over breadth</h2>\n<p>When we started building GitLab's artifact management capabilities six years ago, we faced a classic product decision: support every artifact format imaginable or go deep on the formats that matter most to enterprise teams. We chose depth, and that decision has shaped everything we've built since.</p>\n<h3>Our core focus areas</h3>\n<p>Instead of building shallow support for 20+ formats, we committed to delivering enterprise-grade capabilities for a strategic set:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Maven</strong> (Java ecosystem)</li>\n<li><strong>npm</strong> (JavaScript/Node.js)</li>\n<li><strong>Docker/OCI</strong> (container images)</li>\n<li><strong>PyPI</strong> (Python packages)</li>\n<li><strong>NuGet</strong> (C#/.NET packages)</li>\n<li><strong>Generic packages</strong> (any binary artifact)</li>\n<li><strong>Terraform modules</strong> (infrastructure as code)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These seven formats account for approximately 80% of artifact usage in enterprise environments, based on our customer data.</p>\n<h3>What 'enterprise-grade' actually means</h3>\n<p>By focusing on fewer formats, we can deliver capabilities that work in production environments with hundreds of developers, terabytes of artifacts, and strict compliance requirements:</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/packages/virtual_registry/\">Virtual registries</a>:</strong> Proxy and cache upstream dependencies for reliable builds and supply chain control.

Most complete <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/tutorial-secure-and-optimize-your-maven-repository-in-gitlab/\">Maven virtual registry</a> setup within two months, with minimal GitLab support required.</p>\n<p><strong>Locally-hosted repositories:</strong> All seven supported formats offer complete upload, download, versioning, and access control capabilities supporting critical workloads at organizations with thousands of developers.</p>\n<p><strong>Protected artifacts:</strong> Comprehensive protection preventing unauthorized modifications, supporting fine-grained access controls across all formats.</p>\n<p><strong>Project-level lifecycle policies:</strong> Automated cleanup and retention policies for storage cost control and compliance.</p>\n<h3>Performance and scale characteristics</h3>\n<p>Based on current production deployments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Throughput:</strong> 10,000+ artifact downloads per minute/per instance</li>\n<li><strong>Storage:</strong> Customers successfully managing 50+ TB of artifacts</li>\n<li><strong>Concurrent users:</strong> 1,000+ developers accessing artifacts simultaneously</li>\n<li><strong>Availability:</strong> 99.99% uptime for <a href=\"http://GitLab.com\">GitLab.com</a> for more than 2 years</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Strategic roadmap: Next 18 months</h2>\n<h3>Q1 2026</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>npm virtual registries:</strong> Enterprise proxy/cache for JavaScript packages</li>\n<li><strong>Docker virtual registries:</strong> Container registry proxy capabilities</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q2 2026</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Organization-level lifecycle policies (Beta):</strong> Centralized cleanup policies with project overrides</li>\n<li><strong>NuGet virtual registries (Beta):</strong> .NET package proxy support</li>\n<li><strong>PyPI virtual registries (Beta):</strong> Completing virtual registry support for Python</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q3 2026</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Advanced Analytics Dashboard:</strong> Storage optimization and usage insights</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q4 2026</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dependency Firewall (Beta):</strong> Supply chain security control for all artifact types</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>When to choose GitLab: Decision framework</h2>\n<p><strong>GitLab is likely the right choice if:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>80%+ of your artifacts are in our seven supported formats</li>\n<li>You're already using GitLab for source code or CI/CD</li>\n<li>You value integrated workflows over standalone feature richness</li>\n<li>You want to reduce the operational complexity of managing multiple systems</li>\n<li>You need complete traceability from source to deployment</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Migration considerations</h3>\n<p><strong>Typical timeline:</strong> 2-4 months for complete migration from Artifactory/Nexus</p>\n<p><strong>Common challenges:</strong> Virtual registry configuration, access control mapping, and developer workflow changes</p>\n<p><strong>Success factors:</strong> Phased approach, comprehensive testing, and developer training</p>\n<p>Most successful migrations follow this pattern:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Assessment</strong> (2-4 weeks): Catalog current artifacts and usage patterns</li>\n<li><strong>Pilot</strong> (4-6 weeks): Migrate one team/project end-to-end</li>\n<li><strong>Rollout</strong> (6-12 weeks): Gradual migration with parallel systems</li>\n<li><strong>Optimization</strong> (ongoing): Implement advanced features and policies</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Better artifact management can start today</h2>\n<p>GitLab's artifact management isn't trying to be everything to everyone. We've made strategic trade-offs: deep capabilities for core enterprise formats rather than shallow support for everything.</p>\n<p>If your artifact needs align with our supported formats and you value integrated workflows, we can significantly reduce your operational overhead while improving developer experience.</p>\n<p>Our goal is to help you make informed decisions about your artifact management strategy with a clear understanding of capabilities and our roadmap.</p>\n<p>Please reach out to me at <a href=\"mailto:trizzi@gitlab.com\">trizzi@gitlab.com</a> to learn more about GitLab artifact management.

Atlassian's announcement that <a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/blog/announcements/atlassian-ascend\">all Data Center products will reach end-of-life by March 28, 2029</a>, means thousands of organizations must now reconsider their DevSecOps deployment and infrastructure. But you don't have to settle for deployment options that don't fit your needs. GitLab maintains your freedom to choose \u2014 whether you need self-managed for compliance, cloud for convenience, or hybrid for flexibility \u2014 all within a single AI-powered DevSecOps platform that respects your requirements.</p>\n<p>While other vendors force migrations to cloud-only architectures, GitLab remains committed to supporting the deployment choices that match your business needs. Whether you're managing sensitive government data, operating in air-gapped environments, or simply prefer the control of self-managed deployments, we understand that one size doesn't fit all.</p>\n<h2>The cloud isn't the answer for everyone</h2>\n<p>For the many companies that invested millions of dollars in Data Center deployments, including those that migrated to Data Center <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/atlassian-server-ending-move-to-a-single-devsecops-platform/\">after its Server products were discontinued</a>, this announcement represents more than a product sunset. It signals a fundamental shift away from customer-centric architecture choices, forcing enterprises into difficult positions: accept a deployment model that doesn't fit their needs, or find a vendor that respects their requirements.</p>\n<p>Many of the organizations requiring self-managed deployments represent some of the world's most important organizations: healthcare systems protecting patient data, financial institutions managing trillions in assets, government agencies safeguarding national security, and defense contractors operating in air-gapped environments.</p>\n<p>These organizations don't choose self-managed deployments for convenience; they choose them for compliance, security, and sovereignty requirements that cloud-only architectures simply cannot meet. Organizations operating in closed environments with restricted or no internet access aren't exceptions \u2014 they represent a significant portion of enterprise customers across various industries.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"GitLab vs. Atlassian comparison table\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1759928476/ynl7wwmkh5xyqhszv46m.jpg\" /></p>\n<h2>The real cost of forced cloud migration goes beyond dollars</h2>\n<p>While cloud-only vendors frame mandatory migrations as &quot;upgrades,&quot; organizations face substantial challenges beyond simple financial costs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Lost integration capabilities:</strong> Years of custom integrations with legacy systems, carefully crafted workflows, and enterprise-specific automations become obsolete. Organizations with deep integrations to legacy systems often find cloud migration technically infeasible.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Regulatory constraints:</strong> For organizations in regulated industries, cloud migration isn't just complex \u2014 it's often not permitted. Data residency requirements, air-gapped environments, and strict regulatory frameworks don't bend to vendor preferences. The absence of single-tenant solutions in many cloud-only approaches creates insurmountable compliance barriers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Productivity impacts:</strong> Cloud-only architectures often require juggling multiple products: separate tools for planning, code management, CI/CD, and documentation. Each tool means another context switch, another integration to maintain, another potential point of failure. GitLab research shows <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/developer-survey/\">30% of developers spend at least 50% of their job maintaining and/or integrating their DevSecOps toolchain</a>. Fragmented architectures exacerbate this challenge rather than solving it.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>GitLab offers choice, commitment, and consolidation</h2>\n<p>Enterprise customers deserve a trustworthy technology partner. That's why we've committed to supporting a range of deployment options \u2014 whether you need on-premises for compliance, hybrid for flexibility, or cloud for convenience, the choice remains yours. That commitment continues with <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-duo/\">GitLab Duo</a>, our AI solution that supports developers at every stage of their workflow.</p>\n<p>But we offer more than just deployment flexibility. While other vendors might force you to cobble together their products into a fragmented toolchain, GitLab provides everything in a <strong>comprehensive AI-native DevSecOps platform</strong>. Source code management, CI/CD, security scanning, Agile planning, and documentation are all managed within a single application and a single vendor relationship.</p>\n<p>This isn't theoretical. When <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/customers/airbus/\">Airbus</a> and <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/customers/iron-mountain/\">Iron Mountain</a> evaluated their existing fragmented toolchains, they consistently identified challenges: poor user experience, missing functionalities like built-in security scanning and review apps, and management complexity from plugin troubleshooting. <strong>These aren't minor challenges; they're major blockers for modern software delivery.</strong></p>\n<h2>Your migration path: Simpler than you think</h2>\n<p>We've helped thousands of organizations migrate from other vendors, and we've built the tools and expertise to make your transition smooth:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Automated migration tools:</strong> Our <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/import/bitbucket_server/\">Bitbucket Server importer</a> brings over repositories, pull requests, comments, and even Large File Storage (LFS) objects.

    "url": "https://about.gitlab.com/blog/how-gitlab-transforms-embedded-systems-testing-cycles/",
    "summary": "<p>Embedded developers know this cycle well: write code, wait days or weeks to test on a hardware test bench, discover bugs, fix them, then wait again. Virtual testing environments promise faster feedback, but most implementations create new problems such as environment sprawl and escalating costs.</p>\n<p>GitLab's managed lifecycle environments solve these virtual testing challenges. Through virtual environment automation, GitLab accelerates embedded development cycles without the configuration complexity and cost overruns.</p>\n<h2>Virtual testing challenges</h2>\n<p>Virtual testing environments \u2014 simulated hardware setups that replicate embedded system behavior and real-world conditions \u2014 offer the potential to reduce hardware bottlenecks. Teams can test firmware on simulated processors, run model-in-the-loop (MIL) tests in MATLAB/Simulink, or verify software on virtual embedded systems without waiting for physical hardware access.</p>\n<p>However, teams often implement virtual environments using one of two common approaches, both of which create unsustainable challenges.</p>\n<h3>Flawed approach 1: Pipeline lifecycle environments</h3>\n<p><strong>Pipeline lifecycle environments re-create the entire testing setup for every CI/CD run.</strong> When code changes trigger your CI/CD pipeline, the system provisions infrastructure, installs software simulations, and configures everything from scratch before running tests.</p>\n<p>This approach works for simple scenarios but becomes inefficient as complexity rises. Consider software-in-the-loop (SIL) testing in a complex virtual environment, for example. Each pipeline run requires complete environment re-creation, including virtual processor provisioning, toolchain installations, and target configurations. <strong>These processes can eat up considerable time.</strong></p>\n<p>Moreover, as embedded systems require more sophisticated virtual hardware configurations, the provisioning <strong>costs quickly add up.</strong></p>\n<p>To avoid these rebuild costs and delays, many teams turn to long-lived environments that persist between test runs. But they come with downsides.</p>\n<h3>Flawed approach 2: Long-lived environments</h3>\n<p><strong>Long-lived environments persist indefinitely</strong> to avoid constant rebuilding. Developers request these environments from IT or DevOps teams, wait for approval, then need someone to manually provision the infrastructure. These environments are then tied to individual developers/teams rather than specific code changes, and they support ongoing development work across multiple projects.</p>\n<p>While this eliminates rebuild overhead, <strong>it creates environment sprawl.</strong> Environments accumulate without a clear termination date. Infrastructure costs climb as environments consume resources indefinitely.</p>\n<p>Long-lived environments also suffer from <strong>&quot;config rot&quot;</strong> \u2014 environments retain settings, cached data, or software versions from previous tests that can affect subsequent results. A test that should fail ends up passing due to the residue of previous testing.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, managing long-lived environments is a manual process that slows development velocity and increases operational overhead.</p>\n<p><strong>GitLab offers a third approach</strong> through \u201cmanaged lifecycle environments.\u201d This approach captures the benefits of both long-lived and pipeline lifecycle environments while avoiding the drawbacks.</p>\n<h2>Solution: Managed lifecycle environments</h2>\n<p>GitLab's managed lifecycle environments tie virtual testing setups to merge requests (<a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/merge_requests/\">MRs</a>) rather than pipeline runs or individual developers. You can also think of them as \u201cmanaged MR test environments.\u201d When you create an MR for a new feature, GitLab automatically orchestrates the provisioning of necessary virtual testing environments. These environments persist throughout the entire feature development process.</p>\n<h3>Key benefits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Persistent environments without rebuilding:</strong> The same virtual environment handles multiple pipeline runs as you iterate on your feature. Whether you're running MIL tests in MATLAB/Simulink or SIL tests on specialized embedded processors, the environment remains configured and ready.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Automatic cleanup:</strong> When you merge your feature and delete the branch, GitLab automatically triggers environment cleanup, eliminating environment sprawl.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Single source of truth:</strong> The MR records all build results, test outcomes, and environment metadata in one location. Team members can track progress and collaborate without shuffling between different tools or spreadsheets.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Watch this overview video to see how managed lifecycle environments work in practice:</p>\n<p>&lt;!-- blank line --&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;video_container&quot;&gt;\n&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/9tfyVPK5DuI?si=Kj_xXNo02bnFBDhy&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;!-- blank line --&gt;</p>\n<p>GitLab automates the entire testing workflow. Each time you run firmware tests, GitLab orchestrates testing in the appropriate virtual environment, records results, and provides full visibility into every pipeline run. This approach transforms complex virtual testing from a manual, error-prone process into automated, reliable workflows.</p>\n<p><strong>The result:</strong> Teams get reusable environments without runaway costs. And they increase efficiency while maintaining clean, isolated testing setups for each feature.</p>\n<p>See a demonstration of managed lifecycle environments for testing firmware on virtual hardware:</p>\n<p>&lt;!-- blank line --&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;video_container&quot;&gt;\n&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/iWdY-kTlpH4?si=D6rpoulr9sv6Sl6E&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;!-- blank line --&gt;</p>\n<h2>Business impact</h2>\n<p>GitLab's managed lifecycle environments deliver measurable improvements across embedded development workflows. Teams running MIL testing in MATLAB/Simulink and SIL testing on specialized processors like Infineon AURIX or BlackBerry QNX systems no longer face the tradeoff between constant environment rebuilds or uncontrolled environment sprawl. Instead, these complex virtual testing setups persist throughout feature development while automatically cleaning up when complete, enabling:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Faster product development cycles</li>\n<li>Shorter time-to-market</li>\n<li>Lower infrastructure costs</li>\n<li>Higher quality assurance</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Start transforming virtual testing today</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://learn.gitlab.com/embedded-en/whitepaper-unlocking-agility-embedded-development\"><strong>Download \u201cUnlocking agility and avoiding runaway costs in embedded development\u201d</strong></a> for a deeper exploration of managed lifecycle environments and learn how to accelerate embedded development workflows dramatically.</p>",
