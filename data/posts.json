It compiles them.<p>The goal is to provide a stable planning layer above CI/CD,\norchestrators, and container engines: one Map → many backends.<p>Documentation (Primer, Architecture, Zero-Trust, ADP):\n<a href=\"https://origen-hub.github.io/origen-core-public/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://origen-hub.github.io/origen-core-public/</a><p>This release is documentation-only (v0.0.1).
