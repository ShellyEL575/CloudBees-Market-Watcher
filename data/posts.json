They did not go into detail about which CI solution they plan to switch to. As I'm starting to get annoyed with GitHub Actions myself and looking for alternatives, I had been hoping to hear their experience with an alternative, but I didn't get that.So I'd like to ask HN: if you don't use GitHub Actions, what CI solution did you end up choosing? And what has been your experience with it so far? Finally, if you have also used GitHub Actions, how would you compare your current CI solution to GitHub Actions in terms of pros and cons?P.S. Something with a free tier or a self-hosting option are the only viable options for me, but that doesn't mean I don't want to hear about your experience if you're on a commercial CI solution.\n\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46103040\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 3",

    "summary": "Hey HN, we’re Maya and Riles, and we’ve been working on Orkera (orkera.com); an MCP tool that lets you create and manage backend infrastructure through prompts. It handles database creation/management, deployments, cron jobs, and environment setup, all via MCP calls from your coding agent.Demo video: https://youtu.be/runSblXCYD0Why we built it:\nWe’re part of the startup community in Paris and kept seeing the same bottleneck: people can build a frontend or MVP quickly (especially with Cursor/Claude/Gemini), but the moment they want to share it with users, they hit DevOps friction: setting up a VM, creating a database, configuring deployment, choosing a domain, etc.We wanted to make that step disappear.\nSo we built Orkera: an MCP-based backend layer that tools like Cursor, Claude Code, and Gemini CLI can call to create infra and deploy apps automatically.What it does today:\n- create and manage databases,\n- deploy web apps without cloud setup,\n- handle cron-like scheduled jobs,\n- manage environments through MCP\nAll from inside your vibecoding tool.What we’re looking for:\nThis is the first public version (after some early feedback cycles) and we’d love testers who can tell us what’s missing, what feels weird, and what should be more transparent or configurable.Setup:\nGetting Orkera running is simple; register to get an API key, then add the MCP endpoint to your editor. We published small setup guides for Cursor, Claude Code, and Gemini CLI on orkera.com.Thanks for taking a look, and we’d appreciate feedback, criticism, and suggestions.\n\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46067943\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 2",

Use this guide to plan and execute your migration and complete post-migration follow-up tasks.\nEnterprises migrating from ADO to GitLab commonly follow a multi-phase approach:\n\n\nMigrate repositories from ADO to GitLab using Congregate or GitLab's built-in repository migration.\n\n\nMigrate pipelines from Azure Pipelines to GitLab CI/CD.\n\n\nMigrate remaining assets such as boards, work items, and artifacts to GitLab Issues, Epics, and the Package and Container Registries.\n\n\nHigh-level migration phases:\ngraph LR\n    subgraph Prerequisites\n        direction TB\n        A[\"Set up identity provider (IdP) and<br/>provision users\"]\n        A --> B[\"Set up runners and<br/>third-party integrations\"]\n        B --> I[\"Users enablement and<br/>change management\"]\n    end\n    \n    subgraph MigrationPhase[\"Migration phase\"]\n        direction TB\n        C[\"Migrate source code\"]\n        C --> D[\"Preserve contributions and<br/> format history\"]\n        D --> E[\"Migrate work items and<br/>map to <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/topics/plan_and_track/\">GitLab Plan <br/>and track work\"]\n    end\n    \n    subgraph PostMigration[\"Post-migration steps\"]\n        direction TB\n        F[\"Create or translate <br/>ADO pipelines to GitLab CI\"]\n        F --> G[\"Migrate other assets<br/>packages and container images\"]\n        G --> H[\"Introduce <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/secure_your_application/\">security</a> and<br/>SDLC improvements\"]\n    end\n    \n    Prerequisites --> MigrationPhase\n    MigrationPhase --> PostMigration\n\n    style A fill:#FC6D26\n    style B fill:#FC6D26\n    style I fill:#FC6D26\n    style C fill:#8C929D\n    style D fill:#8C929D\n    style E fill:#8C929D\n    style F fill:#FFA500\n    style G fill:#FFA500\n    style H fill:#FFA500\n\nPlanning your migration\nTo plan your migration, ask these questions:\n\n\nHow soon do we need to complete the migration?\n\n\nDo we understand what will be migrated?\n\n\nWho will run the migration?\n\n\nWhat organizational structure do we want in GitLab?\n\n\nAre there any constraints, limitations, or pitfalls that need to be taken into account?\n\n\nDetermine your timeline, as it will largely dictate your migration approach. Identify champions or groups familiar with both ADO and GitLab platforms (such as early adopters) to help drive adoption and provide guidance.\nInventory what you need to migrate:\n\n\nThe number of repositories, pull requests, and contributors\n\n\nThe number and complexity of work items and pipelines\n\n\nRepository sizes and dependency relationships\n\n\nCritical integrations and runner requirements (agent pools with specific capabilities)\n\n\nUse GitLab Professional Services's Evaluate tool to produce a complete inventory of your entire Azure DevOps organization, including repositories, PR counts, contributor lists, number of pipelines, work items, CI/CD variables and more. If you're working with the GitLab Professional Services team, share this report with your engagement manager or technical architect to help plan the migration.\nMigration timing is primarily driven by pull request count, repository size, and amount of contributions (e.g. comments in PR, work items, etc). For example, 1,000 small repositories with few PRs and limited contributors can migrate much faster than a smaller set of repositories containing tens of thousands of PRs and thousands of contributors. Use your inventory data to estimate effort and plan test runs before proceeding with production migrations.\nCompare inventory against your desired timeline and decide whether to migrate all repositories at once or in batches. If teams cannot migrate simultaneously, batch and stagger migrations to align with team schedules. For example, in Professional Services engagements, we organize migrations into waves of 200-300 projects to manage complexity and respect API rate limits, both in GitLab and ADO.\nGitLab's built-in repository importer migrates Git repositories (commits, branches, and tags) one-by-one. Congregate is designed to preserve pull requests (known in GitLab as merge requests), comments, and related metadata where possible; the simple built-in repository import focuses only on the Git data (history, branches, and tags).\nItems that typically require separate migration or manual recreation:\n\n\nAzure Pipelines - create equivalent GitLab CI/CD pipelines (consult with CI/CD YAML and/or with CI/CD components). Alternatively, consider using AI-based pipeline conversion available in Congregate.\n\n\nWork items and boards - map to GitLab Issues, Epics, and Issue Boards.\n\n\nArtifacts, container images (ACR) - migrate to GitLab Package Registry or Container Registry.\n\n\nService hooks and external integrations - recreate in GitLab.\n\n\nPermissions models differ between ADO and GitLab; review and plan permissions mapping rather than assuming exact preservation.\n\n\nReview what each tool (Congregate vs. built-in import) will migrate and choose the one that fits your needs. Make a list of any data or integrations that must be migrated or recreated manually.\nWho will run the migration?\nMigrations are typically run by a GitLab group owner or instance administrator, or by a designated migrator who has been granted the necessary permissions on the destination group/project. Congregate and the GitLab import APIs require valid authentication tokens for both Azure DevOps and GitLab.\n\n\nDecide whether a group owner/admin will perform the migrations or whether you will grant a specific team/person delegated access.\n\n\nEnsure the migrator has correctly configured personal access tokens (Azure DevOps and GitLab) with the scopes required by your chosen migration tool (for example, api/read_repository scopes and any tool-specific requirements).\n\n\nTest tokens and permissions with a small pilot migration.\n\n\nNote: Congregate leverages file-based import functionality for ADO migrations and requires instance administrator permissions to run (see our documentation). If you are migrating to GitLab.com, consider engaging Professional Services. For more information, see the Professional Services Full Catalog. Non-admin account cannot preserve contribution attribution!\nWhat organizational structure do we want in GitLab?\nWhile it's possible to map ADO structure directly to GitLab structure, it's recommended to rationalize and simplify the structure during migration. Consider how teams will work in GitLab and design the structure to facilitate collaboration and access management. Here is a way to think about mapping ADO structure to GitLab structure:\ngraph TD\n    subgraph GitLab\n        direction TB\n        A[\"Top-level Group\"]\n        B[\"Subgroup (optional)\"]\n        C[\"Projects\"]\n        A --> B\n        A --> C\n        B --> C\n    end\n\n    subgraph AzureDevOps[\"Azure DevOps\"]\n        direction TB\n        F[\"Organizations\"]\n        G[\"Projects\"]\n        H[\"Repositories\"]\n        F --> G\n        G --> H\n    end\n\n    style A fill:#FC6D26\n    style B fill:#FC6D26\n    style C fill:#FC6D26\n    style F fill:#8C929D\n    style G fill:#8C929D\n    style H fill:#8C929D\n\nRecommended approach:\n\n\nMap each ADO organization to a GitLab group (or a small set of groups), not to many small groups. Avoid creating a GitLab group for every ADO team project. Use migration as an opportunity to rationalize your GitLab structure.\n\n\nUse subgroups and project-level permissions to group related repositories.\n\n\nManage access to sets of projects by using GitLab groups and group membership (groups and subgroups) rather than one group per team project.\n\n\nReview GitLab permissions and consider SAML Group Links to implement an enterprise RBAC model for your GitLab instance (or a GitLab.com namespace).\n\n\nADO Boards and work items: State of migration\nIt's important to understand how work items migrate from ADO into GitLab Plan (issues, epics, and boards).\n\n\nADO Boards and work items map to GitLab Issues, Epics, and Issue Boards. Plan how your workflows and board configurations will translate.\n\n\nADO Epics and Features become GitLab Epics.\n\n\nOther work item types (e.g., user stories, tasks, bugs) become project-scoped issues.\n\n\nMost standard fields are preserved; selected custom fields can be migrated when supported.\n\n\nParent-child relationships are retained so Epics reference all related issues.\n\n\nLinks to pull requests are converted to merge request links to maintain development traceability.\n\n\nExample: Migration of an individual work item to a GitLab Issue, including field accuracy and relationships:\n\nBatching guidance:\n\n\nIf you need to run migrations in batches, use your new group/subgroup structure to define batches (for example, by ADO organization or by product area).\n\n\nUse inventory reports to drive batch selection and test each batch with a pilot migration before scaling.\n\n\nPipelines migration\nCongregate recently introduced AI-powered conversion for multi-stage YAML pipelines from Azure DevOps to GitLab CI/CD. This automated conversion works best for simple, single-file pipelines and is designed to provide a working starting point rather than a production-ready .gitlab-ci.yml file. The tool generates a functionally equivalent GitLab pipeline that you can then refine and optimize for your specific needs.\n\n\nConverts Azure Pipelines YAML to .gitlab-ci.yml format automatically.\n\n\nBest suited for straightforward, single-file pipeline configurations.\n\n\nProvides a boilerplate to accelerate migration, not a final production artifact.\n\n\nRequires review and adjustment for complex scenarios, custom tasks, or enterprise requirements.\n\n\nDoes not support Azure DevOps classic release pipelines — convert these to multi-stage YAML first.\n\n\nRepository owners should review the GitLab CI/CD documentation to further optimize and enhance their pipelines after the initial conversion.\nExample of converted pipelines:\n\n# azure-pipelines.yml\n\ntrigger:\n  - main\n\nvariables:\n  imageName: myapp\n\nstages:\n  - stage: Build\n    jobs:\n      - job: Build\n        pool:\n          vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'\n        steps:\n          - checkout: self\n\n          - task: Docker@2\n            displayName: Build Docker image\n            inputs:\n              command: build\n              repository: $(imageName)\n              Dockerfile: '**/Dockerfile'\n              tags: |\n                $(Build.BuildId)\n\n  - stage: Test\n    jobs:\n      - job: Test\n        pool:\n          vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'\n        steps:\n          - checkout: self\n\n          # Example: run tests inside the container\n          - script: |\n              docker run --rm $(imageName):$(Build.BuildId) npm test\n            displayName: Run tests\n\n  - stage: Push\n    jobs:\n      - job: Push\n        pool:\n          vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'\n        steps:\n          - checkout: self\n\n          - task: Docker@2\n            displayName: Login to ACR\n            inputs:\n              command: login\n              containerRegistry: '<your-acr-service-connection>'\n\n          - task: Docker@2\n            displayName: Push image to ACR\n            inputs:\n              command: push\n              repository: $(imageName)\n              tags: |\n                $(Build.BuildId)\n\n\n\n# .gitlab-ci.yml\n\nvariables:\n  imageName: myapp\n\nstages:\n  - build\n  - test\n  - push\n\nbuild:\n  stage: build\n  image: docker:latest\n  services:\n    - docker:dind\n  script:\n    - docker build -t $imageName:$CI_PIPELINE_ID -f $(find . -name Dockerfile) .\n  only:\n    - main\n\ntest:\n  stage: test\n  image: docker:latest\n  services:\n    - docker:dind\n  script:\n    - docker run --rm $imageName:$CI_PIPELINE_ID npm test\n  only:\n    - main\n\npush:\n  stage: push\n  image: docker:latest\n  services:\n    - docker:dind\n  before_script:\n    - docker login -u $CI_REGISTRY_USER -p $CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD $CI_REGISTRY\n  script:\n    - docker tag $imageName:$CI_PIPELINE_ID $CI_REGISTRY/$CI_PROJECT_PATH/$imageName:$CI_PIPELINE_ID\n    - docker push $CI_REGISTRY/$CI_PROJECT_PATH/$imageName:$CI_PIPELINE_ID\n  only:\n    - main\n\n\nFinal checklist:\n\n\nDecide timeline and batch strategy.\n\n\nProduce a full inventory of repositories, PRs, and contributors.\n\n\nChoose Congregate or the built-in import based on scope (PRs and metadata vs. Git data only).\n\n\nDecide who will run migrations and ensure tokens/permissions are configured.\n\n\nIdentify assets that must be migrated separately (pipelines, work items, artifacts, and hooks) and plan those efforts.\n\n\nRun pilot migrations, validate results, then scale according to your plan.\n\n\nRunning your migrations\nAfter planning, execute migrations in stages, starting with trial runs. Trial migrations help surface org-specific issues early and let you measure duration, validate outcomes, and fine-tune your approach before production.\nWhat trial migrations validate:\n\n\nWhether a given repository and related assets migrate successfully (history, branches, tags; plus MRs/comments if using Congregate)\n\n\nWhether the destination is usable immediately (permissions, runners, CI/CD variables, integrations)\n\n\nHow long each batch takes, to set schedules and stakeholder expectations\n\n\nDowntime guidance:\n\n\nGitLab's built-in Git import and Congregate do not inherently require downtime.\n\n\nFor production waves, freeze changes in ADO (branch protections or read-only) to avoid missed commits, PR updates, or work items created mid-migration.\n\n\nTrial runs do not require freezes and can be run anytime.\n\n\nBatching guidance:\n\n\nRun trial batches back-to-back to shorten elapsed time; let teams validate results asynchronously.\n\n\nUse your planned group/subgroup structure to define batches and respect API rate limits.\n\n\nRecommended steps:\n\nCreate a test destination in GitLab for trials:\n\n\n\nGitLab.com: create a dedicated group/namespace (for example, my-org-sandbox)\n\n\nSelf-managed: create a top-level group or a separate test instance if needed\n\n\n\nPrepare authentication:\n\n\n\nAzure DevOps PAT with required scopes.\n\n\nGitLab Personal Access Token with api and read_repository (plus admin access for file-based imports used by Congregate).\n\n\n\nRun trial migrations:\n\n\n\nRepos only: use GitLab's built-in import (Repo by URL)\n\n\nRepos + PRs/MRs and additional assets: use Congregate\n\n\n\nPost-trial follow-up:\n\n\n\nVerify repo history, branches, tags; merge requests (if migrated), issues/epics (if migrated), labels, and relationships.\n\n\nCheck permissions/roles, protected branches, required approvals, runners/tags, variables/secrets, integrations/webhooks.\n\n\nValidate pipelines (.gitlab-ci.yml) or converted pipelines where applicable.\n\n\n\n\nAsk users to validate functionality and data fidelity.\n\n\nResolve issues uncovered during trials and update your runbooks.\n\n\nNetwork and security:\n\n\n\nIf your destination uses IP allow lists, add the IPs of your migration host and any required runners/integrations so imports can succeed.\n\n\nRun production migrations in waves:\n\n\n\nEnforce change freezes in ADO during each wave.\n\n\nMonitor progress and logs; retry or adjust batch sizes if you hit rate limits.\n\n\n\nOptional: remove the sandbox group or archive it after you finish.\n\n<figure class=\"video_container\">\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ibIXGfrVbi4?si=ZxOVnXjCF-h4Ne0N\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe>\n</figure>\nTerminology reference for GitLab and Azure DevOps\n\n\n\nGitLab\nAzure DevOps\nSimilarities & Key Differences\n\n\n\n\nGroup\nOrganization\nTop-level namespace, membership, policies.
