    "url": "https://www.deployfreeze.com/",
    "summary": "Hi HN; I built DeployFreeze after getting tired of engineers frantically pinging “@here, don’t deploy product-service” during incidents and investigations.DeployFreeze is a GitHub App that creates deployment freezes using GitHub’s custom deployment protection rules (https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/deploy/configure-...). It pauses deployments to specific environments without blocking merges or CI, and gives teams a single place to see what’s frozen and why.This is particularly useful in monorepos, where you might want to freeze `production-api` while keeping `production-web` or staging deployable. The app only uses deployment webhooks and doesn’t require access to source code.If you don’t use GitHub Actions but still see “Deployments” in your repo sidebar, this may work for you. Many platforms use GitHub’s deployment API behind the scenes, so you may already be set up even if you didn’t explicitly configure it.I’d love feedback on how your teams handle deployment freezes today or any thoughts on this approach. There’s a 30-day free trial if you want to try it for upcoming end-of-year freezes.\n\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46313715\nPoints: 5\n# Comments: 0",
