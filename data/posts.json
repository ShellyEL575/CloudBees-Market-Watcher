    "url": "https://orkera.com/",
    "summary": "<p>Hey HN, we\u2019re Maya and Riles, and we\u2019ve been working on Orkera (orkera.com); an MCP tool that lets you create and manage backend infrastructure through prompts. It handles database creation/management, deployments, cron jobs, and environment setup, all via MCP calls from your coding agent.<p>Demo video: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/runSblXCYD0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/runSblXCYD0</a><p>Why we built it:\nWe\u2019re part of the startup community in Paris and kept seeing the same bottleneck: people can build a frontend or MVP quickly (especially with Cursor/Claude/Gemini), but the moment they want to share it with users, they hit DevOps friction: setting up a VM, creating a database, configuring deployment, choosing a domain, etc.<p>We wanted to make that step disappear.\nSo we built Orkera: an MCP-based backend layer that tools like Cursor, Claude Code, and Gemini CLI can call to create infra and deploy apps automatically.<p>What it does today:\n- create and manage databases,\n- deploy web apps without cloud setup,\n- handle cron-like scheduled jobs,\n- manage environments through MCP\nAll from inside your vibecoding tool.<p>What we\u2019re looking for:\nThis is the first public version (after some early feedback cycles) and we\u2019d love testers who can tell us what\u2019s missing, what feels weird, and what should be more transparent or configurable.<p>Setup:\nGetting Orkera running is simple; register to get an API key, then add the MCP endpoint to your editor. We published small setup guides for Cursor, Claude Code, and Gemini CLI on orkera.com.<p>Thanks for taking a look, and we\u2019d appreciate feedback, criticism, and suggestions.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46067943\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46067943</a></p>\n<p>Points: 4</p>\n<p># Comments: 2</p>",
