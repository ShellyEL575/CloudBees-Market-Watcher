    "summary": "<p>OriGen is a deterministic workflow compiler.<p>It takes declarative Maps (YAML) and produces a backend-neutral\nIntermediate Representation (Route). Guides then translate the IR\ninto native execution artifacts: Kubernetes Jobs, CI configs, or\nlocal container scripts.<p>The key properties:<p>• Deterministic planning (no execution during compilation)<p>• Digest-pinned toolchains (Navigators)<p>• Immutable resource bundles (Backpacks)<p>• Planning/execution separation<p>• Backend neutrality (K8s first, others follow)<p>• Zero-trust emerges as architecture (no hidden behavior)<p>• Automatic Digital Provenance (ADP) falls out of determinism<p>OriGen does *not* run workflows. It compiles them.<p>The goal is to provide a stable planning layer above CI/CD,\norchestrators, and container engines: one Map → many backends.<p>Documentation (Primer, Architecture, Zero-Trust, ADP):\n<a href=\"https://origen-hub.github.io/origen-core-public/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://origen-hub.github.io/origen-core-public/</a><p>This release is documentation-only (v0.0.1).

    "url": "https://orkera.com/",
    "summary": "<p>Hey HN, we’re Maya and Riles, and we’ve been working on Orkera (orkera.com); an MCP tool that lets you create and manage backend infrastructure through prompts. It handles database creation/management, deployments, cron jobs, and environment setup, all via MCP calls from your coding agent.<p>Demo video: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/runSblXCYD0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/runSblXCYD0</a><p>Why we built it:\nWe’re part of the startup community in Paris and kept seeing the same bottleneck: people can build a frontend or MVP quickly (especially with Cursor/Claude/Gemini), but the moment they want to share it with users, they hit DevOps friction: setting up a VM, creating a database, configuring deployment, choosing a domain, etc.<p>We wanted to make that step disappear.\nSo we built Orkera: an MCP-based backend layer that tools like Cursor, Claude Code, and Gemini CLI can call to create infra and deploy apps automatically.<p>What it does today:\n- create and manage databases,\n- deploy web apps without cloud setup,\n- handle cron-like scheduled jobs,\n- manage environments through MCP\nAll from inside your vibecoding tool.<p>What we’re looking for:\nThis is the first public version (after some early feedback cycles) and we’d love testers who can tell us what’s missing, what feels weird, and what should be more transparent or configurable.<p>Setup:\nGetting Orkera running is simple; register to get an API key, then add the MCP endpoint to your editor. We published small setup guides for Cursor, Claude Code, and Gemini CLI on orkera.com.<p>Thanks for taking a look, and we’d appreciate feedback, criticism, and suggestions.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46067943\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46067943</a></p>\n<p>Points: 4</p>\n<p># Comments: 2</p>",
