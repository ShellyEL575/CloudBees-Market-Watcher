    "url": "https://www.deployfreeze.com/",
    "summary": "Hi HN; I built DeployFreeze after getting tired of engineers frantically pinging “@here, don’t deploy product-service” during incidents and investigations.DeployFreeze is a GitHub App that creates deployment freezes using GitHub’s custom deployment protection rules (https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/deploy/configure-...). It pauses deployments to specific environments without blocking merges or CI, and gives teams a single place to see what’s frozen and why.This is particularly useful in monorepos, where you might want to freeze `production-api` while keeping `production-web` or staging deployable. The app only uses deployment webhooks and doesn’t require access to source code.If you don’t use GitHub Actions but still see “Deployments” in your repo sidebar, this may work for you. Many platforms use GitHub’s deployment API behind the scenes, so you may already be set up even if you didn’t explicitly configure it.I’d love feedback on how your teams handle deployment freezes today or any thoughts on this approach. There’s a 30-day free trial if you want to try it for upcoming end-of-year freezes.\n\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46313715\nPoints: 5\n# Comments: 0",

It reads your codebase, analyzes its structure and intent using ASTs and inference, and generates a deterministic infrastructure spec called neptune.json. You can inspect every change, approve it, and apply it. Think: coding agents that can actually ship safely to AWS.How it works in practice:1. Take any of your existing apps\n2. Install Neptune mcp & login\n3. Tell your agent to deploy\n4. Watch it do everything else for you and (super important) it keeps you in the loop at every step, asking for your approval and guidance. We’ve spent most of our time implementing guardrails to make this as safe as if you were doing it yourself.We built this after seeing teams rely on AI to write services, but still hand-craft Terraform and YAML. The AI could write code, but it could not understand the system around it. Neptune tries to close that gap.Right now we have support for the most basic AWS products (ECS, S3, SecretManager), and we support postgres (thanks to Neon) and we are adding more resources as we speak. For now, your apps are all deployed to our a shared tenancy AWS account, and “bring your own cloud” account is coming soon too.If you are also excited about a future where coding agents can help you reliably ship stuff into production, try it and share what you think.If you have tried it on shared tenancy and would like to run it in your own AWS account, just get in touch and we’d be happy to help.\n\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46276419\nPoints: 18\n# Comments: 8",

    "url": "https://about.gitlab.com/blog/gitlab-18-7-advancing-ai-automation/",
    "summary": "GitLab 18.7 delivers development, operations, and security capabilities that strengthen control, improve consistency, and build confidence as teams integrate AI further into their workflows. These improvements arrive as GitLab approaches a major milestone. GitLab Duo Agent Platform will reach general availability in January 2026 with our 18.8 release, pending we continue to meet the exceptionally high quality standards we set for ourselves in service to our customers worldwide across all industries.GitLab Duo Agent Platform's GA is designed to introduce a unified, governed way for organizations to orchestrate agentic AI across their software lifecycle. With foundational agents, custom agents, and automated flows working together inside GitLab, teams will be able to adopt agentic workflows that help accelerate work while staying aligned to organizational standards. At GA, we also plan to include expanded AI Catalog functionality, stronger administrative controls, reliability enhancements, and a flexible usage-based billing model designed to provide flexibility for agentic AI usage across many roles and projects.The 18.7 release adds important building blocks to support GitLab Duo Agent Platform’s upcoming GA. New automation features, stronger governance controls, and enhancements across security and pipeline authoring help teams streamline their work and lay the groundwork for an even more reliable agentic experience in 18.8 and beyond.On February 10, 2026, we will host a global event that brings our vision of GitLab as the intelligent orchestration platform to life, where software teams and their AI agents stay in flow. You will hear how customers are tackling the AI paradox in software delivery, see intelligent orchestration in action across DevSecOps workflows, and get a jump start on what this next chapter means for your own modernization journey. Reserve your spot to see how GitLab’s next chapter comes together.Here's what is new in 18.7:GitLab Duo Agent PlatformAs more teams bring AI into their development and security workflows, GitLab continues to focus on making adoption powerful and predictable. The updates in 18.7 strengthen the foundation for guided, governed AI experiences that will become fully realized when GitLab Duo Agent Platform reaches GA, as planned for 18.8.Custom FlowsCustom Flows introduce a new way for teams to automate multistep workflows using YAML-defined sequences that orchestrate agents to complete repetitive development tasks. Custom Flows help eliminate manual effort for scenarios that follow predictable patterns — such as diagnosing and fixing failed pipelines, updating dependencies, or running policy checks when reviewers are assigned. Instead of handling these tasks interactively, teams can define flows that automatically trigger from GitLab events like mentions and assignments. This capability supports developers who want tailored automations for their own projects, as well as administrators who need consistent, organization-wide workflows for compliance and operational efficiency.SAST False Positive Detection FlowAI-powered false positive management for Static Application Security Testing (SAST) works to introduce a faster, more accurate way for teams to assess and act on potential false positives. GitLab now uses AI to help identify which findings may be false positives earlier in the review process, reducing the time developers and security teams spend triaging noise. Users can see an overview of how many vulnerabilities may warrant review, track their analysis progress, and dismiss false positives directly from the vulnerability report. Once dismissed, these findings stay dismissed across future pipelines and continue to reflect the correct dismissed status in merge request widgets. This assists with a consistent and reliable signal as code evolves and helps teams focus on real risks, streamline remediation, and cut down on unnecessary security review cycles.Custom Agent VersioningCustom Agent Versioning gives teams control over which version of an AI Catalog agent or flow they use in their projects. Instead of automatically inheriting updates from the creator, GitLab now pins each project to the exact version of the agent and flow enabled for the team. This helps prevent breaking changes, security risks, and workflow disruptions, especially in production pipelines or security-sensitive environments. Teams can upgrade when they choose, test new versions in staging before promoting them, and clearly see which version is running to avoid confusion. It also enables safer customization by letting users fork an agent at a specific version and evolve it independently. The result is a more predictable, stable, and secure way to adopt custom agents across development and CI/CD workflows.New Settings for Foundational AgentsAdmins now have the ability to turn foundational agents on or off, giving teams greater control over how AI is used across their organization. With this update, admins can enable or disable these agents at the instance or group level, choose default availability, and control how new agents are introduced while still providing access to the core agent. The result is more flexible AI adoption with the governance, consistency, and control enterprise teams need.Data Analyst AgentThe Data Analyst Agent gives teams a simple way to explore GitLab data using natural language, automatically generating GitLab Query Language (GLQL)  queries, retrieving relevant information, and presenting clear insights without requiring dashboards or manual query writing. Users can analyze work volume, understand team activity, identify development trends, monitor issue and merge request status, and quickly discover work items by labels, authors, milestones, or other criteria. It also creates reusable GLQL queries that can be embedded anywhere GitLab Flavored Markdown is supported, making it easier to share findings and answer everyday questions about project activity directly within GitLab.Core DevOpsInnovations with GitLab Duo Agent Platform are most effective when the underlying DevOps experience is equally streamlined and dependable. The improvements in 18.7 to core GitLab workflows help ensure that automation, pipelines, and reusable components operate with highest levels of clarity and consistency.Dynamic Input Selection in GitLab PipelinesDynamic Input Selection in GitLab Pipelines introduces a more intuitive way to trigger pipelines through dynamic, cascading dropdown fields in the GitLab UI. This allows cross-functional teams to run pipelines without editing YAML or relying on developers, while ensuring that only valid, context-aware options are shown as they make selections. The feature supports complex workflows, assists with reducing misconfigured runs, and removes a key blocker for teams migrating from Jenkins Active Choice, helping organizations standardize their CI/CD processes entirely on GitLab.CI/CD Catalog Publication GuardrailsAdministrators of GitLab Self-Managed and GitLab Dedicated can now control which projects are allowed to publish components to the CI/CD Catalog. This new setting helps organizations maintain a curated, trusted ecosystem by ensuring only approved sources can add components. It strengthens governance for enterprise customers who want to preserve control over their CI/CD landscape while still enabling teams to discover and reuse sanctioned components.Platform SecurityAs automation and pipeline workflows become more efficient, it remains essential that teams maintain strong visibility and control over how code changes meet organizational standards. The Platform Security update in 18.7 reinforces this balance by giving teams a more flexible way to introduce and refine policy guidance without interrupting delivery.Warn Mode for MR Approval PoliciesWarn Mode for MR Approval Policies allows violations to be surfaced without blocking merges, giving teams a lower-friction way to introduce or adjust policies while assessing their impact before full enforcement. It also supports a guidance-based approach, where developers can review or dismiss violations with all actions audited to help AppSec refine policy effectiveness. Beyond merge requests, violations already present or introduced into the default branch now appear with a visual badge in the Vulnerability Report, making it easier to identify and prioritize issues that break policy.Elevating how teams build, secure, and deliver softwareThe 18.7 release is about strengthening the foundation for reliable, flexible automation across your GitLab environment.GitLab Premium and Ultimate users can start using these capabilities today on GitLab.com and self-managed environments, with availability for GitLab Dedicated customers planned for next month.GitLab Duo Agent Platform is currently in beta — enable beta and experimental features to experience how full-context AI can transform the way your teams build software.

    "title": "<p>When Dr. James Quilty began developing engineering project management courses at Victoria Univers",
    "url": "https://about.gitlab.com/blog/taming-tool-sprawl-how-to-boost-university-it-productivity/",
    "summary": "When Dr. James Quilty began developing engineering project management courses at Victoria University of Wellington's School of Engineering and Computer Science, he didn't find an organized system for delivering course content. Instead, he was faced with chaos.The problem was that back in 2015 learning materials were scattered across a dozen different tools, like the Blackboard platform, customized Wiki pages, personal websites, and shared Google Docs. On top of that, students were left to choose their own tools for coursework. All of this led to a constant state of confusion. As if that weren’t enough, few of these disparate systems provided proper version history or reliable issue tracking.This all-too-familiar lack of standardization was creating massive headaches for both lecturers and students.\"Information was fragmented across multiple files, multiple formats — sitting often on file systems, not necessarily under good version control,\" says Quilty, who is now program director for engineering at the New Zealand university.After consolidating on GitLab Self-Managed Ultimate in 2017, Victoria University saw 483% growth in student users by 2021. They also added 35 GitLab-enabled courses and now host more than 8,000 projects. The university also deployed GitLab as a unified DevSecOps platform for academic coursework, replacing what had become a fragmented and complicated toolchain. More importantly, they've redirected faculty time from administration to actual education.This pattern isn't unique. Across higher education, IT teams struggle with the same tool sprawl — multiple tools and incompatible systems that lead to hours lost to context switching and administering disparate and costly tools. Simplifying how teams build and deliver software is the answer to this widespread problem.The teams making real progress are reducing complexity instead of creating it.Facing the complexity problemHigher education IT teams are faced with managing aging infrastructure, legacy systems, and resource constraints that force difficult tradeoffs with every technology decision they have to make.Development workflows exist in silos since many departments use different version control systems, CI/CD tools, and security scanners. That means teams struggle to collaborate on cross-functional projects because they're working with incompatible toolchains and a lack of shared visibility.Legacy technology compounds these problems. Many institutions run development environments that are outdated and incompatible with modern DevSecOps practices. But replacing them isn't realistic when budgets are tight and IT staff are already stretched thin.To take on these problems, institutions need to modernize, but because of administrative processes, budget constraints, and the reality of managing critical systems, they have to do it in phases, not overnight. For instance, some workloads may move to the cloud while others remain on-premises. A research department, for instance, might shift large datasets off-site while central IT functions stay in-house.Organizations need the flexibility to be able to do that, and that’s what they get with GitLab Ultimate, the enterprise-ready DevSecOps platform that delivers the same capabilities whether you deploy on GitLab.com or self-host on your own infrastructure: on-premises servers, data centers, or cloud providers, including AWS, GCP, Azure, or even multi-cloud. Self-hosted deployments include all features, including air-gapped support for sensitive environments.This means, with GitLab Ultimate, institutions can modernize on their own timeline without abandoning governance requirements or forcing wholesale infrastructure changes.Moving from manual compliance to automated enforcementIT teams also have to work with regulatory mandates and that adds another layer of complexity. Student privacy requirements, research grant stipulations, and institutional security policies all demand audit trails and governance controls. For institutions supporting U.S. Department of Defense research or contractors, CMMC 2.0 compliance requirements add stringent cybersecurity controls based on NIST SP 800-171. Meeting these obligations while modernizing traditionally meant manually documenting everything — a process that didn't scale easily.In conversations with team members from educational institutions at events like EDUCAUSE we've learned it's all too common for dedicated compliance staff to spend the majority of their time gathering evidence for audits, instead of actually improving security. Not building better software. Just proving that policies were followed. This administrative burden extends to development teams, as well. According to Forrester Consulting’s study The Total Economic Impact™ of GitLab Ultimate, which was commissioned by GitLab, software development team members save 90% of the time previously spent on annual auditing and compliance efforts after adopting GitLab's end-to-end platform.GitLab saves all of that time and effort by enabling automation through custom compliance frameworks that map multiple, overlapping controls from different standards and regulations into a single, unified structure. They then cascade automatically from the instance level to all subgroups and projects, ensuring consistent enforcement without manual configuration.Pipeline execution policies enforce compliance directly in CI/CD pipelines where development work happens. Rather than operating disparate governance, risk, and compliance tools, compliance validation occurs automatically as code moves through the pipeline. To make all of this easier, GitLab’s Compliance Center provides oversight through dashboards that show where projects fail to meet framework requirements — whether due to failed security scans or other control gaps.Complete audit trails also capture every code change with timestamps and attribution. And policy-as-code enforces security rules that can't be bypassed. When an auditor asks who changed what code and when, you have the answer instantly — without weeks spent manually gathering evidence. Every pipeline execution automatically generates compliance documentation, enabling teams to instantly prove adherence to requirements and quickly identify any control gaps.AI: Governance over guessworkThis visibility across the entire security posture matters now more than ever. Artificial intelligence (AI) is changing how software gets built with many teams testing AI code generation tools to enable them to move faster. But higher education institutions are uniquely positioned to lead on a critical question: How do you adopt AI responsibly?Cornell University and Cal State Fullerton already are developing ethical frameworks for AI use, asking essential questions about transparency, explainability, and bias. The University of California San Diego is adapting its existing data governance framework — originally built for analytics platforms — to secure its on-premises AI assistants, ensuring the same access controls and approval workflows that protect institutional data now extend to AI-driven tools. Educational institutions understand that AI adoption requires more than just enabling new tools — it requires proper oversight and protection.The problem isn't AI itself. It's AI without guardrails integrated into development workflows. Most organizations haven't considered what secure AI development looks like — what governance is needed for AI-generated code, how to maintain visibility into what gets committed to repositories, or how to ensure the same rigor applies whether code comes from a human or AI.This is exactly where platform-level AI integration becomes essential. GitLab Duo Agent Platform goes beyond fragmented AI tools and coding assistants alone to provide an orchestration layer that integrates AI across the entire software development lifecycle.AI agents handle planning, testing, security remediation, and deployment tasks, while working alongside developers rather than just generating code on command. When security scans identify vulnerabilities, for example, AI agents explain findings, assess risks, and prioritize issues to reduce noise and accelerate mean time to recovery (MTTR). This platform approach ensures AI accelerates development without compromising the security standards and governance controls institutions require.The benefits extend beyond technical capabilities. Through GitLab's AI Transparency Center, institutions get clear documentation of data privacy protections, AI ethics principles, and vendor selection processes. This means schools can adopt AI tools while maintaining the governance standards they're developing institution-wide.AI will change how we build software. The question is whether institutions can do it with the same responsible approach they're bringing to AI adoption across campus.See results in your education environmentThe universities making real progress aren't adding more tools to manage complexity. They're consolidating onto platforms that prevent problems rather than just detecting them, creating visibility and automation across their development workflows.Forrester's The Total Economic Impact™ of GitLab Ultimate study found that a composite organization representative of interviewed customers reclaimed up to 305 hours per developer year through automated testing within a single interface, eliminating constant context switching between tools. New hires ramped to full productivity 75% faster — in 1.5 weeks instead of 1.5 months. Teams spend their time building rather than maintaining fragmented toolchains.Your institution can achieve similar results.
